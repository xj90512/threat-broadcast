<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-53820</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-07-14 21:15:28<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] WeGIA is an open source web manager with a focus on the Portuguese language and charitable institutions. A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the `index.php` endpoint of the WeGIA application prior to version 3.4.5. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts in the `erro` parameter. Version 3.4.5 contains a patch for the issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-53820'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-53820</a>

Builds with Nix 2.30.0 on macOS were executed with elevated privileges (root), instead of the build users. The fix was applied to Nix 2.30.1. No known workarounds are available.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-53819'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-53819</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-53818</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-07-14 21:15:27<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] GitHub Kanban MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for managing GitHub issues in Kanban board format and streamlining LLM task management. Versions 0.3.0 and 0.4.0 of the MCP Server are written in a way that is vulnerable to command injection vulnerability attacks as part of some of its MCP Server tool definition and implementation. The MCP Server exposes the tool `add_comment` which relies on Node.js child process API `exec` to execute the GitHub (`gh`) command, is an unsafe and vulnerable API if concatenated with untrusted user input. As of time of publication, no known patches are available.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-53818'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-53818</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-53643</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-07-14 21:15:27<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] AIOHTTP is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. Prior to version 3.12.14, the Python parser is vulnerable to a request smuggling vulnerability due to not parsing trailer sections of an HTTP request. If a pure Python version of aiohttp is installed (i.e. without the usual C extensions) or AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS is enabled, then an attacker may be able to execute a request smuggling attack to bypass certain firewalls or proxy protections. Version 3.12.14 contains a patch for this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-53643'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-53643</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-53640</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-07-14 21:15:27<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Indico is an event management system that uses Flask-Multipass, a multi-backend authentication system for Flask. Starting in version 2.2 and prior to version 3.3.7, an endpoint used to display details of users listed in certain fields (such as ACLs) could be misused to dump basic user details (such as name, affiliation and email) in bulk. Version 3.3.7 fixes the issue. Owners of instances that allow everyone to create a user account, who wish to truly restrict access to these user details, should consider restricting user search to managers. As a workaround, it is possible to restrict access to the affected endpoints (e.g. in the webserver config), but doing so would break certain form fields which could no longer show the details of the users listed in those fields, so upgrading instead is highly recommended.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-53640'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-53640</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-53639</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-07-14 20:15:29<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] MeterSphere is an open source continuous testing platform. Prior to version 3.6.5-lts, the sortField parameter in certain API endpoints is not properly validated or sanitized. An attacker can supply crafted input to inject and execute arbitrary SQL statements through the sorting functionality. This could result in modification or deletion of database contents, with a potential full compromise of the application’s database integrity and availability. Version 3.6.5-lts fixes the issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-53639'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-53639</a>

This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system where the application is running, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data leakage, or complete system compromise. The issue is fixed in versions `1.11.0` and above. Users can mitigate the risk by avoiding the use of untrusted input in the `CsvEnumerator` class and ensuring that any file paths are properly sanitized and validated before being passed to the class methods. Users should avoid using the `count_of_rows_in_file` method with untrusted CSV filenames.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-53623'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-53623</a>

In versions prior to 7.1.2-0 and 6.9.13-26, in ImageMagick's `magick mogrify` command, specifying multiple consecutive `%d` format specifiers in a filename template causes internal pointer arithmetic to generate an address below the beginning of the stack buffer, resulting in a stack overflow through `vsnprintf()`. Versions 7.1.2-0 and 6.9.13-26 fix the issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-53101'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-53101</a>
