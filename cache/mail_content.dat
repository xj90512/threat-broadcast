<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-4315</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-06-11 10:15:21<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The CubeWP – All-in-One Dynamic Content Framework plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.23. This is due to the plugin allowing a user to update arbitrary user meta through the update_user_meta() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to elevate their privileges to that of an administrator.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-4315'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-4315</a>

An attacker needs either physical access or remote shell access to a device that interacts directly with the modem via AT commands.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-26412'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-26412</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-5991</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-06-11 08:15:22<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] There is a "Use After Free" vulnerability in Qt's QHttp2ProtocolHandler in the QtNetwork module. This only affects HTTP/2 handling, HTTP handling is not affected by this at all. This happens due to a race condition between how QHttp2Stream uploads the body of a POST request and the simultaneous handling of HTTP error responses. This issue only affects Qt 6.9.0 and has been fixed for Qt 6.9.1.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-5991'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-5991</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-29756</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-06-11 08:15:21<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] SunGrow's back end users system iSolarCloud https://isolarcloud.com uses an MQTT service to transport data from the user's connected devices to the user's web browser. The MQTT server however did not have sufficient restrictions in place to limit the topics that a user could subscribe to. While the data that is transmitted through the MQTT server is encrypted and the credentials for the MQTT server are obtained though an API call, the credentials could be used to subscribe to any topic and the encryption key can be used to decrypt all messages received. An attack with an account on iSolarCloud.com could extract MQTT credentials and the decryption key from the browser and then use an external program to subscribe to the topic '#' and thus recieve all messages from all connected devices.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-29756'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-29756</a>

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-5395'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-5395</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-35295</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-06-11 07:15:24<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability has been identified in Perfect Harmony GH180 (All versions >= V8.0 < V8.3.3 with NXGPro+ controller manufactured between April 2020 to April 2025). The maintenance connection of affected devices fails to protect access to the device's control unit configuration. This could allow an attacker with physical access to the maintenance connection's door port to perform arbitrary configuration changes.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-35295'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-35295</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-4799</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-06-11 04:15:59<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The WP-DownloadManager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to lack of restriction on the directory a file can be deleted from in all versions up to, and including, 1.68.10. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php). This vulnerability can be paired with CVE-2025-4798 to delete any file within the WordPress root directory.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-4799'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-4799</a>
