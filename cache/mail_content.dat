<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-45327</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-09-11 10:15:02<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] An improper authorization vulnerability [CWE-285] in FortiSOAR version 7.4.0 through 7.4.3, 7.3.0 through 7.3.2, 7.2.0 through 7.2.2, 7.0.0 through 7.0.3 change password endpoint may allow an authenticated attacker to perform a brute force attack on users and administrators password via crafted HTTP requests.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-45327'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-45327</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-8277</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-09-11 09:15:02<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The WooCommerce Photo Reviews Premium plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.13.2. This is due to the plugin not properly validating what user transient is being used in the login() function and not properly verifying the user's identity. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as user that has dismissed an admin notice in the past 30 days, which is often an administrator. Alternatively, a user can log in as any user with any transient that has a valid user_id as the value, though it would be more difficult to exploit this successfully.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-8277'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-8277</a>

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2019-25212'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2019-25212</a>

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to move arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is moved (such as wp-config.php). This can also lead to the reading of arbitrary files that may contain sensitive information like wp-config.php.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-7626'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-7626</a>
