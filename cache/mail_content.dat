<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-27964</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-06-23 18:15:11 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] An authentication issue was addressed with improved state management. This issue is fixed in AirPods Firmware Update 5E133. When your headphones are seeking a connection request to one of your previously paired devices, an attacker in Bluetooth range might be able to spoof the intended source device and gain access to your headphones.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-27964'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-27964</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-27535</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-03-30 20:15:07 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in libcurl &lt;8.0.0 in the FTP connection reuse feature that can result in wrong credentials being used during subsequent transfers. Previously created connections are kept in a connection pool for reuse if they match the current setup. However, certain FTP settings such as CURLOPT_FTP_ACCOUNT, CURLOPT_FTP_ALTERNATIVE_TO_USER, CURLOPT_FTP_SSL_CCC, and CURLOPT_USE_SSL were not included in the configuration match checks, causing them to match too easily. This could lead to libcurl using the wrong credentials when performing a transfer, potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-27535'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-27535</a>
