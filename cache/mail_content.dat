<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-49113</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-06-20 13:15:49<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The Kiuwan Local Analyzer (KLA) Java scanning application contains several hard-coded secrets in plain text format. In some cases, this can potentially compromise the confidentiality of the scan results. Several credentials were found in the JAR files of the Kiuwan Local Analyzer. The JAR file "lib.engine/insight/optimyth-insight.jar" contains the file "InsightServicesConfig.properties", which has the configuration tokens "insight.github.user" as well as "insight.github.password" prefilled with credentials. At least the specified username corresponds to a valid GitHub account. The JAR file "lib.engine/insight/optimyth-insight.jar" also contains the file "es/als/security/Encryptor.properties", in which the key used for encrypting the results of any performed scan. This issue affects Kiuwan SAST: <master.1808.p685.q13371<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-49113'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-49113</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-49112</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-06-20 13:15:49<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Kiuwan provides an API endpoint /saas/rest/v1/info/application to get information about any application, providing only its name via the "application" parameter. This endpoint lacks proper access control mechanisms, allowing other authenticated users to read information about applications, even though they have not been granted the necessary rights to do so. This issue affects Kiuwan SAST: <master.1808.p685.q13371<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-49112'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-49112</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-49111</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-06-20 13:15:49<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] For Kiuwan installations with SSO (single sign-on) enabled, an unauthenticated reflected cross-site scripting attack can be performed on the login page "login.html". This is possible due to the request parameter "message" values being directly included in a JavaScript block in the response. This is especially critical in business environments using AD SSO authentication, e.g. via ADFS, where attackers could potentially steal AD passwords.

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-49110</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-06-20 13:15:49<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] When the Kiuwan Local Analyzer uploads the scan results to the Kiuwan SAST web application (either on-premises or cloud/SaaS solution), the transmitted data consists of a ZIP archive containing several files, some of them in the XML file format. During Kiuwan's server-side processing of these XML files, it resolves external XML entities, resulting in a XML external entity injection attack. An attacker with privileges to scan source code within the "Code Security" module is able to extract any files of the operating system with the rights of the application server user and is potentially able to gain sensitive files, such as configuration and passwords. Furthermore, this vulnerability also allows an attacker to initiate connections to internal systems, e.g. for port scans or accessing other internal functions / applications such as the Wildfly admin console of Kiuwan.
