<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-27416</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-03-01 01:15:28<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Scratch-Coding-Hut.github.io is the website for Coding Hut. The website as of 28 February 2025 contained a sign in with scratch username and password form. Any user who used the sign in page would be susceptible to any other user signing into their account. As of time of publication, a fix is not available but work on a fix is underway. As a workaround, users should avoid signing in.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-27416'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-27416</a>

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-26466</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-02-28 22:15:40<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A flaw was found in the OpenSSH package. For each ping packet the SSH server receives, a pong packet is allocated in a memory buffer and stored in a queue of packages. It is only freed when the server/client key exchange has finished. A malicious client may keep sending such packages, leading to an uncontrolled increase in memory consumption on the server side. Consequently, the server may become unavailable, resulting in a denial of service attack.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-26466'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-26466</a>

HSTS is an optional response header that can be configured on the server to instruct the browser to only communicate via HTTPS. The lack of HSTS allows downgrade attacks, SSL-stripping man-in-the-middle attacks, and weakens cookie-hijacking protections.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-1509'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-1509</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-27414</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-02-28 21:15:27<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] MinIO is a high performance object storage. Starting in RELEASE.2024-06-06T09-36-42Z and prior to RELEASE.2025-02-28T09-55-16Z, a bug in evaluating the trust of the SSH key used in an SFTP connection to MinIO allows authentication bypass and unauthorized data access. On a MinIO server with SFTP access configured and using LDAP as an external identity provider, MinIO supports SSH key based authentication for SFTP connections when the user has the `sshPublicKey` attribute set in their LDAP server. The server trusts the client's key only when the public key is the same as the `sshPublicKey` attribute. Due to the bug, when the user has no `sshPublicKey` property in LDAP, the server ends up trusting the key allowing the client to perform any FTP operations allowed by the MinIO access policies associated with the LDAP user (or any of their groups). Three requirements must be met in order to exploit the vulnerability. First, the MinIO server must be configured to allow SFTP access and use LDAP as an external identity provider. Second, the attacker must have knowledge of an LDAP username that does not have the `sshPublicKey` property set. Third, such an LDAP username or one of their groups must also have some MinIO access policy configured. When this bug is successfully exploited, the attacker can perform any FTP operations (i.e. reading, writing, deleting and listing objects) allowed by the access policy associated with the LDAP user account (and their groups). Version 1.2.0 fixes the issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-27414'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-27414</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-27413</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-02-28 21:15:27<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] PwnDoc is a penetration test reporting application. Prior to version 1.2.0, the backup restore functionality allows an administrator to import raw data into the database, including Path Traversal (`../`) sequences. This is problematic for the template update functionality as it uses the path from the database to write arbitrary content to, potentially overwriting source code to achieve Remote Code Execution. Any user with the `backups:create`, `backups:update` and `templates:update` permissions (only administrators by default) can write arbitrary content to anywhere on the filesystem. By overwriting source code, it is possible to achieve Remote Code Execution. Version 1.2.0 fixes the issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-27413'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-27413</a>
