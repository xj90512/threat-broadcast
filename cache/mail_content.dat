Other parameters might be affected as well.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-3120'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-3120</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-31484</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-04-02 22:15:20<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] conda-forge infrastructure holds common configurations and settings for key pieces of the conda-forge infrastructure. Between 2025-02-10 and 2025-04-01, conda-forge infrastructure used the wrong token for Azure's cf-staging access. This bug meant that any feedstock maintainer could upload a package to the conda-forge channel, bypassing our feedstock-token + upload process. The security logs on anaconda.org were check for any packages that were not copied from the cf-staging to the conda-forge channel and none were found.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-31484'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-31484</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-31479</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-04-02 22:15:20<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] canonical/get-workflow-version-action is a GitHub composite action to get commit SHA that GitHub Actions reusable workflow was called with. Prior to 1.0.1, if the get-workflow-version-action step fails, the exception output may include the GITHUB_TOKEN. If the full token is included in the exception output, GitHub will automatically redact the secret from the GitHub Actions logs. However, the token may be truncated—causing part of the GITHUB_TOKEN to be displayed in plaintext in the GitHub Actions logs. Anyone with read access to the GitHub repository can view GitHub Actions logs. For public repositories, anyone can view the GitHub Actions logs. The opportunity to exploit this vulnerability is limited—the GITHUB_TOKEN is automatically revoked when the job completes. However, there is an opportunity for an attack in the time between the GITHUB_TOKEN being displayed in the logs and the completion of the job. Users using the github-token input are impacted. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.0.1.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-31479'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-31479</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-31477</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-04-02 22:15:20<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The Tauri shell plugin allows access to the system shell. Prior to 2.2.1, the Tauri shell plugin exposes functionality to execute code and open programs on the system. The open endpoint of this plugin is designed to allow open functionality with the system opener (e.g. xdg-open on Linux). This was meant to be restricted to a reasonable number of protocols like https or mailto by default. This default restriction was not functional due to improper validation of the allowed protocols, allowing for potentially dangerous protocols like file://, smb://, or nfs:// and others to be opened by the system registered protocol handler. By passing untrusted user input to the open endpoint these potentially dangerous protocols can be abused to gain remote code execution on the system. This either requires direct exposure of the endpoint to application users or code execution in the frontend of a Tauri application. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.2.1.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-31477'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-31477</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-3119</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-04-02 22:15:20<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability was found in SourceCodester Online Tutor Portal 1.0. It has been declared as critical. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the file /tutor/courses/manage_course.php. The manipulation of the argument ID leads to sql injection. The attack can be initiated remotely.

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-30218</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-04-02 22:15:19<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. To mitigate CVE-2025-29927, Next.js validated the x-middleware-subrequest-id which persisted across multiple incoming requests. However, this subrequest ID is sent to all requests, even if the destination is not the same host as the Next.js application. Initiating a fetch request to a third-party within Middleware will send the x-middleware-subrequest-id to that third party. This vulnerability is fixed in 12.3.6, 13.5.10, 14.2.26, and 15.2.4.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-30218'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-30218</a>
