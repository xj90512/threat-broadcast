<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-46929</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-01-03 19:15:08<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] An issue discovered in GPAC 2.3-DEV-rev605-gfc9e29089-master in MP4Box in gf_avc_change_vui /afltest/gpac/src/media_tools/av_parsers.c:6872:55 allows attackers to crash the application.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-46929'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-46929</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-21633</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-01-03 17:15:13<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Apktool is a tool for reverse engineering Android APK files. In versions 2.9.1 and prior, Apktool infers resource files' output path according to their resource names which can be manipulated by attacker to place files at desired location on the system Apktool runs on. Affected environments are those in which an attacker may write/overwrite any file that user has write access, and either user name is known or cwd is under user folder. Commit d348c43b24a9de350ff6e5bd610545a10c1fc712 contains a patch for this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-21633'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-21633</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-21631</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-01-03 17:15:12<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Vapor is an HTTP web framework for Swift. Prior to version 4.90.0, Vapor's `vapor_urlparser_parse` function uses `uint16_t` indexes when parsing a URI's components, which may cause integer overflows when parsing untrusted inputs. This vulnerability does not affect Vapor directly but could impact applications relying on the URI type for validating user input. The URI type is used in several places in Vapor. A developer may decide to use URI to represent a URL in their application (especially if that URL is then passed to the HTTP Client) and rely on its public properties and methods. However, URI may fail to properly parse a valid (albeit abnormally long) URL, due to string ranges being converted to 16-bit integers. An attacker may use this behavior to trick the application into accepting a URL to an untrusted destination. By padding the port number with zeros, an attacker can cause an integer overflow to occur when the URL authority is parsed and, as a result, spoof the host. Version 4.90.0 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, validate user input before parsing as a URI or, if possible, use Foundation's `URL` and `URLComponents` utilities.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-21631'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-21631</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-21622</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-01-03 17:15:12<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Craft is a content management system. This is a potential moderate impact, low complexity privilege escalation vulnerability in Craft starting in 3.x prior to 3.9.6 and 4.x prior to 4.4.16 with certain user permissions setups. This has been fixed in Craft 4.4.16 and Craft 3.9.6. Users should ensure they are running at least those versions.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-21622'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-21622</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-0217</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-01-03 17:15:12<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A use-after-free flaw was found in PackageKitd. In some conditions, the order of cleanup mechanics for a transaction could be impacted. As a result, some memory access could occur on memory regions that were previously freed. Once freed, a memory region can be reused for other allocations and any previously stored data in this memory region is considered lost.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-0217'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-0217</a>

By utilizing the ProxyCommand or ProxyJump feature, users can exploit unchecked hostname syntax on the client. This issue may allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the command of the features mentioned through the hostname parameter.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-6004'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-6004</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-50253</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-01-03 17:15:11<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Laf is a cloud development platform. In the Laf version design, the log uses communication with k8s to quickly retrieve logs from the container without the need for additional storage. However, in version 1.0.0-beta.13 and prior, this interface does not verify the permissions of the pod, which allows authenticated users to obtain any pod logs under the same namespace through this method, thereby obtaining sensitive information printed in the logs. As of time of publication, no known patched versions exist.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-50253'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-50253</a>

CubeFS prior to version 3.3.1 was found to leak users secret keys and access keys in the logs in multiple components. When CubeCS creates new users, it leaks the users secret key. This could allow a lower-privileged user with access to the logs to retrieve sensitive information and impersonate other users with higher privileges than themselves. The issue has been patched in v3.3.1. There is no other mitigation than upgrading CubeFS.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-46742'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-46742</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-46741</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-01-03 17:15:10<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] CubeFS is an open-source cloud-native file storage system. A vulnerability was found in CubeFS prior to version 3.3.1 that could allow users to read sensitive data from the logs which could allow them escalate privileges. CubeFS leaks configuration keys in plaintext format in the logs. These keys could allow anyone to carry out operations on blobs that they otherwise do not have permissions for. For example, an attacker that has succesfully retrieved a secret key from the logs can delete blogs from the blob store. The attacker can either be an internal user with limited privileges to read the log, or they can be an external user who has escalated privileges sufficiently to access the logs. The vulnerability has been patched in v3.3.1. There is no other mitigation than upgrading.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-46741'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-46741</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-46740</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-01-03 17:15:10<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] CubeFS is an open-source cloud-native file storage system. Prior to version 3.3.1, CubeFS used an insecure random string generator to generate user-specific, sensitive keys used to authenticate users in a CubeFS deployment. This could allow an attacker to predict and/or guess the generated string and impersonate a user thereby obtaining higher privileges. When CubeFS creates new users, it creates a piece of sensitive information for the user called the “accessKey”. To create the "accesKey", CubeFS uses an insecure string generator which makes it easy to guess and thereby impersonate the created user. An attacker could leverage the predictable random string generator and guess a users access key and impersonate the user to obtain higher privileges. The issue has been fixed in v3.3.1. There is no other mitigation than to upgrade.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-46740'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-46740</a>
