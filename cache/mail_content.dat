<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-3180</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-04-03 19:15:44<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Concrete CMS version 9 below 9.2.8 and previous versions below 8.5.16 is vulnerable to Stored XSS in blocks of type file. Prior to fix, stored XSS could be caused by a rogue administrator adding malicious code to the link-text field when creating a block of type file. The Concrete CMS security team gave this vulnerability a CVSS v3.1 score of 3.1 with a vector of AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator .

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-3179</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-04-03 19:15:44<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Concrete CMS version 9 before 9.2.8 and previous versions before 8.5.16 are vulnerable to Stored XSS in the Custom Class page editing. Prior to the fix, a rogue administrator could insert malicious code in the custom class field due to insufficient validation of administrator provided data. The Concrete CMS security team gave this vulnerability a CVSS v3.1 score of 3.1 with a vector of AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator .<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-3179'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-3179</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-3178</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-04-03 19:15:44<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Concrete CMS versions 9 below 9.2.8 and versions below 8.5.16 are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in the Advanced File Search Filter. Prior to the fix, a rogue administrator could add malicious code in the file manager because of insufficient validation of administrator provided data. All administrators have access to the File Manager and hence could create a search filter with the malicious code attached. The Concrete CMS security team gave this vulnerability a CVSS v3.1 score of 3.1 with a vector of AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator .<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-3178'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-3178</a>

This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Foxit PDF Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of Doc objects. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.
