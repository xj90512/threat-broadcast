<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-5596</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-06-22 06:15:11<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The ARMember Premium plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 6.7. This is due to incorrectly implemented nonce validation function on multiple functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify, or delete user meta and plugin options which can lead to limited privilege escalation.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-5596'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-5596</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-4940</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-06-22 06:15:11<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] An open redirect vulnerability exists in the gradio-app/gradio, affecting the latest version. The vulnerability allows an attacker to redirect users to arbitrary websites, which can be exploited for phishing attacks, Cross-site Scripting (XSS), Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), amongst others. This issue is due to improper validation of user-supplied input in the handling of URLs. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious URL that, when processed by the application, redirects the user to an attacker-controlled web page.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-4940'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-4940</a>

This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ubermenu_delete_all_item_settings and ubermenu_reset_settings functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete and reset the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-3593'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-3593</a>

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to modify posts and pages created by other users including admins. As a requirement for this, an admin would have to enable access to the editor specifically for such a user or enable it for all users with a certain user account type.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-4874'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-4874</a>

An Arbitrary File Creation issue was identified via the database restoration functionality. By injecting PHP code into the database, an attacker with admin privileges can create a backup file with an arbitrary filename (including the extension), within /system/storage/backup. **Note:** It is less likely for the created file to be available within the web root, as part of the security recommendations for the application suggest moving the storage path outside of the web root.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-21519'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-21519</a>
