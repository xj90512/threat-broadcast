<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-53961</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-12-23 21:15:05<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] ColdFusion versions 2023.11, 2021.17 and earlier are affected by an Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') vulnerability that could lead to arbitrary file system read. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory set by the application. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information or the manipulation of system data.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-53961'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-53961</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-56363</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-12-23 18:15:07<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] APTRS (Automated Penetration Testing Reporting System) is a Python and Django-based automated reporting tool designed for penetration testers and security organizations. In 1.0, there is a vulnerability in the web application's handling of user-supplied input that is incorporated into a Jinja2 template. Specifically, when user input is improperly sanitized or validated, an attacker can inject Jinja2 syntax into the template, causing the server to execute arbitrary code. For example, an attacker might be able to inject expressions like {{ config }}, {{ self.class.mro[1].subclasses() }}, or more dangerous payloads that trigger execution of arbitrary Python code. The vulnerability can be reproduced by submitting crafted input to all the template fields handled by ckeditor, that are passed directly to a Jinja2 template. If the input is rendered without sufficient sanitization, it results in the execution of malicious Jinja2 code on the server.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-56363'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-56363</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-56362</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-12-23 18:15:07<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Navidrome is an open source web-based music collection server and streamer. Navidrome stores the JWT secret in plaintext in the navidrome.db database file under the property table. This practice introduces a security risk because anyone with access to the database file can retrieve the secret. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.54.1.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-56362'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-56362</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-53276</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-12-23 18:15:07<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Home-Gallery.org is a self-hosted open-source web gallery to browse personal photos and videos. In 1.15.0 and earlier, an open CORS policy in app.js may allow an attacker to view the images of home-gallery when it is using the default settings. The following express middleware allows any website to make a cross site request to home-gallery, thus allowing them to read any endpoint on home-gallery. Home-gallery is mostly safe from cross-site requests due to most of its pages requiring JavaScript, and cross-site requests such as fetch() do not render javascript. If an attacker is able to get the path of the preview images which are randomized, an attacker will be able to view such a photo. If any static files or endpoints are introduced in the future that contain sensitive information, they will be accessible to an attacker website.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-53276'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-53276</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-53275</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-12-23 18:15:07<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Home-Gallery.org is a self-hosted open-source web gallery to browse personal photos and videos. In 1.15.0 and earlier, the default setup of home-gallery is vulnerable to DNS rebinding. Home-gallery is set up without TLS and user authentication by default, leaving it vulnerable to DNS rebinding. In this attack, an attacker will ask a user to visit their website. The attacker website will then change the DNS records of their domain from their IP address to the internal IP address of the home-gallery instance. To tell which IP addresses are valid, we can rebind a subdomain to each IP address we want to check, and see if there is a response. Once potential candidates have been found, the attacker can launch the attack by reading the response of the web server after the IP address has changed. When the attacker domain is fetched, the response will be from the home-gallery instance, not the attacker website, because the IP address has been changed. Due to a lack of authentication, home-gallery photos can then be extracted by the attacker website.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-53275'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-53275</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-40896</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-12-23 17:15:08<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] In libxml2 2.11 before 2.11.9, 2.12 before 2.12.9, and 2.13 before 2.13.3, the SAX parser can produce events for external entities even if custom SAX handlers try to override entity content (by setting "checked"). This makes classic XXE attacks possible.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-40896'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-40896</a>

Starting in 1.0.12 and ending in 1.1.13, when calling the extended toHTMLEx method, it is possible to execute arbitrary JavaScript code. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.1.13.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-56364'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-56364</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-56326</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-12-23 16:15:07<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Jinja is an extensible templating engine. Prior to 3.1.5, An oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment detects calls to str.format allows an attacker that controls the content of a template to execute arbitrary Python code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates. Jinja's sandbox does catch calls to str.format and ensures they don't escape the sandbox. However, it's possible to store a reference to a malicious string's format method, then pass that to a filter that calls it. No such filters are built-in to Jinja, but could be present through custom filters in an application. After the fix, such indirect calls are also handled by the sandbox. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.1.5.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-56326'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-56326</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-56201</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-12-23 16:15:07<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Jinja is an extensible templating engine. Prior to 3.1.5, a bug in the Jinja compiler allows an attacker that controls both the content and filename of a template to execute arbitrary Python code, regardless of if Jinja's sandbox is used. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control both the filename and the contents of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates where the template author can also choose the template filename. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.1.5.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-56201'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-56201</a>
