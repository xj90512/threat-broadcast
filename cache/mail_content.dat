<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-43663</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-01-09 08:15:29<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] There are many buffer overflow vulnerabilities present in several CGI binaries of the charging station.This issue affects Iocharger firmware for AC model chargers beforeversion 24120701. Likelihood: High – Given the prevalence of these buffer overflows, and the clear error message of the web server, an attacker is very likely to be able to find these vulnerabilities. Impact: Low – Usually, overflowing one of these buffers just causes a segmentation fault of the CGI binary, which causes the web server to return a 502 Bad Gateway error. However the webserver itself is not affected, and no DoS can be achieved. Abusing these buffer overflows in a meaningful way requires highly technical knowledge, especially since ASLR also seems to be enabled on the charging station. However, a skilled attacker might be able to use one of these buffer overflows to obtain remote code execution. CVSS clarification. The attack can be executed over any network connection the station is listening to and serves the web interface (AV:N), and there are no additional security measure sin place that need to be circumvented (AC:L), the attack does not rely on preconditions (AT:N). The attack does require authentication, but the level of authentication is irrelevant (PR:L), it does not require user interaction (UI:N). The attack has a small impact on the availability of the device (VC:N/VI:N/VA:L). There is no impact on subsequent systems. (SC:N/SI:N/SA:N). While this device is an EV charger handing significant amounts of power, we do not expect this vulnerability to have a safety impact. The attack can be automated (AU:Y).<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-43663'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-43663</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-43662</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-01-09 08:15:29<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The <redacted>.exe or <redacted>.exe CGI binary can be used to upload arbitrary files to /tmp/upload/ or /tmp/ respectively as any user, although the user interface for uploading files is only shown to the iocadmin user. This issue affects Iocharger firmware for AC models before version 24120701. Likelihood: Moderate – An attacker will need to have knowledge of this CGI binary, e.g. by finding it in firmware. Furthermore, the attacker will need a (low privilege) account to gain access to the <redacted>.exe or <redacted>.exe CGI binary and upload the file, or convince a user with such access to upload it. Impact: Low – The attacker can upload arbitrary files to /tmp/upload/ or /tmp/. However, the attacker is unable to access or use these files without other vulnerabilities. CVSS clarification. The attack can be executed over any network connection the station is listening to and serves the web interface (AV:N), and there are no additional security measure sin place that need to be circumvented (AC:L), the attack does not rely on preconditions (AT:N). The attack does require authentication, but the level of authentication is irrelevant (PR:L), it does not require user interaction (UI:N). Artitrary files can be uploaded, be these files will not be in a location where they can influence confidentiality or availability and have a minimal impact on device integrity (VC:N/VI:L/VA:N). There is no impact on subsequent systems. (SC:N/SI:N/SA:N). While this device is an EV charger handing significant amounts of power, we do not expect this vulnerability to have a safety impact. The attack can be automated (AU:Y).<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-43662'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-43662</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-43661</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-01-09 08:15:29<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The <redacted>.so library, which is used by <redacted>, is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the code that handles the deletion of certificates. This buffer overflow can be triggered by providing a long file path to the <redacted> action of the <redacted>.exe CGI binary or to the <redacted>.sh CGI script. This binary or script will write this file path to <redacted>, which is then read by <redacted>.so This issue affects Iocharger firmware for AC models before version 24120701. Likelihood: Moderate – An attacker will have to find this exploit by either obtaining the binaries involved in this vulnerability, or by trial and error. Furthermore, the attacker will need a (low privilege) account to gain access to the <redacted>.exe CGI binary or <redacted>.sh script to trigger the vulnerability, or convince a user with such access send an HTTP request that triggers it. Impact: High – The <redacted> process, which we assume is responsible for OCPP communication, will keep crashing after performing the exploit. This happens because the buffer overflow causes the process to segfault before <redacted> is removed. This means that, even though <redacted> is automatically restarted, it will crash again as soon as it tries to parse the text file. CVSS clarification. The attack can be executed over any network connection the station is listening to and serves the web interface (AV:N), and there are no additional security measure sin place that need to be circumvented (AC:L), the attack does not rely on preconditions (AT:N). The attack does require authentication, but the level of authentication is irrelevant (PR:L), it does not require user interaction (UI:N). The attack leads to reducred availability of the device (VC:N/VI:N/VA:H). THere is not impact on subsequent systems. (SC:N/SI:N/SA:N). Alltough this device is an EV charger handing significant amounts of power, we do not forsee a safety impact. The attack can be automated (AU:Y). Because the DoS condition is written to disk persistantly, it cannot be recovered by the user (R:I).<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-43661'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-43661</a>

This issue affects Iocharger firmware for AC model chargers beforeversion 24120701. Likelihood: High, but credentials required. Impact: Critical – The script can be used to download any file on the filesystem, including sensitive files such as /etc/shadow, the CGI script source code or binaries and configuration files. CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/S:P/AU:Y CVSS clarification. The attack can be executed over any network connection the station is listening to and serves the web interface (AV:N), and there are no additional security measure sin place that need to be circumvented (AC:L), the attack does not rely on preconditions (AT:N). The attack does require authentication, but the level of authentication is irrelevant (PR:L), it does not require user interaction (UI:N). The confidentiality of all files of the devicd can be compromised (VC:H/VI:N/VA:N). There is no impact on subsequent systems. (SC:N/SI:N/SA:N). While this device is an EV charger handing significant amounts of power, this attack in isolation does not have a safety impact. The attack can be automated (AU:Y).<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-43660'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-43660</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-43659</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-01-09 08:15:29<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] After gaining access to the firmware of a charging station, a file at <redacted> can be accessed to obtain default credentials that are the same across all Iocharger AC model EV chargers. This issue affects Iocharger firmware for AC models before firmware version 25010801. The issue is addressed by requiring a mandatory password change on first login, it is still recommended to change the password on older models. Likelihood: Moderate – The attacker will first have to abuse a code execution or file inclusion vulnerability (for example by using <redacted>.sh) to gain access to the <redacted>.json file, or obtain a firmware dump of the charging station or obtain the firmware via other channels. Impact: Critical – All chargers using Iocharger firmware for AC models started with the same initial password. For models with firmware version before 25010801 a password change was not mandatory. It is therefore very likely that this firmware password is still active on many chargers. These credentials could, once obtained, allow an attacker to log into many Iocharger charging station, and allow them to execute arbitrary commands via the System → Custom page. CVSS clarification: Any network interface serving the web ui is vulnerable (AV:N) and there are not additional security measures to circumvent (AC:L), nor does the attack require and existing preconditions (AT:N). The attack is authenticated, and requires high privileges (PR:H), there is no user interaction required (UI:N). The attack leads to a compromised of the confidentialy of the "super user" credentials of the device (VC:H/VI:N/VA:N), and can subsequently be used to full compromise and other devices (SC:H/SI:H/SA:H). Becuase this is an EV charger handing significant power, there is a potential safety impact (S:P). This attack can be automated (AU:Y).<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-43659'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-43659</a>
