<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-6377</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-12-13 07:15:30<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A flaw was found in xorg-server. Querying or changing XKB button actions such as moving from a touchpad to a mouse can result in out-of-bounds memory reads and writes. This may allow local privilege escalation or possible remote code execution in cases where X11 forwarding is involved.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-6377'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-6377</a>

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-46675</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-12-13 07:15:23<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] An issue was discovered by Elastic whereby sensitive information may be recorded in Kibana logs in the event of an error or in the event where debug level logging is enabled in Kibana. Elastic has released Kibana 8.11.2 which resolves this issue. The messages recorded in the log may contain Account credentials for the kibana_system user, API Keys, and credentials of Kibana end-users, Elastic Security package policy objects which can contain private keys, bearer token, and sessions of 3rd-party integrations and finally Authorization headers, client secrets, local file paths, and stack traces. The issue may occur in any Kibana instance running an affected version that could potentially receive an unexpected error when communicating to Elasticsearch causing it to include sensitive data into Kibana error logs. It could also occur under specific circumstances when debug level logging is enabled in Kibana. Note: It was found that the fix for ESA-2023-25 in Kibana 8.11.1 for a similar issue was incomplete.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-46675'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-46675</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-46671</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-12-13 07:15:22<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] An issue was discovered by Elastic whereby sensitive information may be recorded in Kibana logs in the event of an error. Elastic has released Kibana 8.11.1 which resolves this issue. The error message recorded in the log may contain account credentials for the kibana_system user, API Keys, and credentials of Kibana end-users. The issue occurs infrequently, only if an error is returned from an Elasticsearch cluster, in cases where there is user interaction and an unhealthy cluster (for example, when returning circuit breaker or no shard exceptions).<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-46671'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-46671</a>
