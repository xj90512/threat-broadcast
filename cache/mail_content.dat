Previously, StreamPipes allowed users to configure custom endpoints from which to install additional pipeline elements. These endpoints were not properly validated, allowing an attacker to get StreamPipes to send an HTTP GET request to an arbitrary address. This issue affects Apache StreamPipes: through 0.93.0. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 0.95.0, which fixes the issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-31979'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-31979</a>

This allows an attacker to potentially request the creation of multiple accounts with the same email address until the email address is registered, creating many identical users and corrupting StreamPipe's user management. This issue affects Apache StreamPipes: through 0.93.0. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 0.95.0, which fixes the issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-30471'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-30471</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-29737</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-07-17 09:15:02<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] In streampark, the project module integrates Maven's compilation capabilities. The input parameter validation is not strict, allowing attackers to insert commands for remote command execution, The prerequisite for a successful attack is that the user needs to log in to the streampark system and have system-level permissions. Generally, only users of that system have the authorization to log in, and users would not manually input a dangerous operation command. Therefore, the risk level of this vulnerability is very low. Mitigation: all users should upgrade to 2.1.4 Background info: Log in to Streampark using the default username (e.g. test1, test2, test3) and the default password (streampark). Navigate to the Project module, then add a new project. Enter the git repository address of the project and input `touch /tmp/success_2.1.2` as the "Build Argument". Note that there is no verification and interception of the special character "`". As a result, you will find that this injection command will be successfully executed after executing the build. In the latest version, the special symbol ` is intercepted.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-29737'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-29737</a>
