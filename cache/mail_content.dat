<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-49515</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-01-17 02:15:06<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Insecure Permissiosn vulnerability in TP Link TC70 and C200 WIFI Camera v.3 firmware v.1.3.4 and fixed in v.1.3.11 allows a physically proximate attacker to obtain sensitive information via a connection to the UART pin components.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-49515'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-49515</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-22409</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-01-16 23:15:08<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] DataHub is an open-source metadata platform. In affected versions a low privileged user could remove a user, edit group members, or edit another user's profile information. The default privileges gave too many broad permissions to low privileged users. These have been constrained in PR #9067 to prevent abuse. This issue can result in privilege escalation for lower privileged users up to admin privileges, potentially, if a group with admin privileges exists. May not impact instances that have modified default privileges. This issue has been addressed in datahub version 0.12.1. Users are advised to upgrade.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-22409'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-22409</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-22408</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-01-16 23:15:08<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Shopware is an open headless commerce platform. The implemented Flow Builder functionality in the Shopware application does not adequately validate the URL used when creating the “call webhook” action. This enables malicious users to perform web requests to internal hosts. This issue has been fixed in the Commercial Plugin release 6.5.7.4 or with the Security Plugin. For installations with Shopware 6.4 the Security plugin is recommended to be installed and up to date. For older versions of 6.4 and 6.5 corresponding security measures are also available via a plugin. For the full range of functions, we recommend updating to the latest Shopware version.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-22408'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-22408</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-22407</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-01-16 23:15:08<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Shopware is an open headless commerce platform. In the Shopware CMS, the state handler for orders fails to sufficiently verify user authorizations for actions that modify the payment, delivery, and/or order status. Due to this inadequate implementation, users lacking 'write' permissions for orders are still able to change the order state. This issue has been addressed and users are advised to update to Shopware 6.5.7.4. For older versions of 6.1, 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4 corresponding security measures are also available via a plugin. For the full range of functions, we recommend updating to the latest Shopware version.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-22407'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-22407</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-22406</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-01-16 23:15:08<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Shopware is an open headless commerce platform. The Shopware application API contains a search functionality which enables users to search through information stored within their Shopware instance. The searches performed by this function can be aggregated using the parameters in the “aggregations” object. The ‘name’ field in this “aggregations” object is vulnerable SQL-injection and can be exploited using time-based SQL-queries. This issue has been addressed and users are advised to update to Shopware 6.5.7.4. For older versions of 6.1, 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4 corresponding security measures are also available via a plugin. For the full range of functions, we recommend updating to the latest Shopware version.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-22406'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-22406</a>

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-22411</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-01-16 22:15:46<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Avo is a framework to create admin panels for Ruby on Rails apps. In Avo 3 pre12 any HTML inside text that is passed to `error` or `succeed` in an `Avo::BaseAction` subclass will be rendered directly without sanitization in the toast/notification that appears in the UI on Action completion. A malicious user could exploit this vulnerability to trigger a cross site scripting attack on an unsuspecting user. This issue has been addressed in the 3.0.0 release of Avo. Users are advised to upgrade.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-22411'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-22411</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-22192</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-01-16 22:15:46<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Ursa is a cryptographic library for use with blockchains. The revocation scheme that is part of the Ursa CL-Signatures implementations has a flaw that could impact the privacy guarantees defined by the AnonCreds verifiable credential model. Notably, a malicious verifier may be able to generate a unique identifier for a holder providing a verifiable presentation that includes a Non-Revocation proof. The impact of the flaw is that a malicious verifier may be able to determine a unique identifier for a holder presenting a Non-Revocation proof. Ursa has moved to end-of-life status and no fix is expected.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-22192'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-22192</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-22191</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-01-16 22:15:46<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Avo is a framework to create admin panels for Ruby on Rails apps. A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was found in the key_value field of Avo v3.2.3. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. The value of the key_value is inserted directly into the HTML code. In the current version of Avo (possibly also older versions), the value is not properly sanitized before it is inserted into the HTML code. This vulnerability could be used to steal sensitive information from victims that could be used to hijack victims' accounts or redirect them to malicious websites. Avo 3.2.4 includes a fix for this issue. Users are advised to upgrade.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-22191'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-22191</a>
