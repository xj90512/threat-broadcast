<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-3419</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-05-08 06:15:32<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The Event Manager, Events Calendar, Tickets, Registrations – Eventin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file read in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.26 via the proxy_image() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-3419'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-3419</a>

This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-13793'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-13793</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-32873</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-05-08 04:17:18<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] An issue was discovered in Django 4.2 before 4.2.21, 5.1 before 5.1.9, and 5.2 before 5.2.1. The django.utils.html.strip_tags() function is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (slow performance) when processing inputs containing large sequences of incomplete HTML tags. The template filter striptags is also vulnerable, because it is built on top of strip_tags().<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-32873'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-32873</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-55651</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-05-08 00:15:15<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] i-Educar is free, fully online school management software. Version 2.9 of the application fails to properly validate and sanitize user supplied input, leading to a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability that resides within the user type (Tipo de Usuário) input field. Through this attacker vector a malicious user might be able to retrieve information belonging to another user, which may lead to sensitive information leakage or other malicious actions. As of time of publication, no patched versions are known to exist.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-55651'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-55651</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-46727</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-05-07 23:15:54<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. Prior to versions 2.2.14, 3.0.16, and 3.1.14, `Rack::QueryParser` parses query strings and `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` bodies into Ruby data structures without imposing any limit on the number of parameters, allowing attackers to send requests with extremely large numbers of parameters. The vulnerability arises because `Rack::QueryParser` iterates over each `&`-separated key-value pair and adds it to a Hash without enforcing an upper bound on the total number of parameters. This allows an attacker to send a single request containing hundreds of thousands (or more) of parameters, which consumes excessive memory and CPU during parsing. An attacker can trigger denial of service by sending specifically crafted HTTP requests, which can cause memory exhaustion or pin CPU resources, stalling or crashing the Rack server. This results in full service disruption until the affected worker is restarted. Versions 2.2.14, 3.0.16, and 3.1.14 fix the issue. Some other mitigations are available. One may use middleware to enforce a maximum query string size or parameter count, or employ a reverse proxy (such as Nginx) to limit request sizes and reject oversized query strings or bodies. Limiting request body sizes and query string lengths at the web server or CDN level is an effective mitigation.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-46727'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-46727</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-35939</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-05-07 23:15:54<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Craft CMS stores arbitrary content provided by unauthenticated users in session files. This content could be accessed and executed, possibly using an independent vulnerability. Craft CMS redirects requests that require authentication to the login page and generates a session file on the server at `/var/lib/php/sessions`. Such session files are named `sess_[session_value]`, where `[session_value]` is provided to the client in a `Set-Cookie` response header. Craft CMS stores the return URL requested by the client without sanitizing parameters. Consequently, an unauthenticated client can introduce arbitrary values, such as PHP code, to a known local file location on the server. Craft CMS versions 5.7.5 and 4.15.3 have been released to address this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-35939'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-35939</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-32441</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-05-07 23:15:53<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. Prior to version 2.2.14, when using the `Rack::Session::Pool` middleware, simultaneous rack requests can restore a deleted rack session, which allows the unauthenticated user to occupy that session. Rack session middleware prepares the session at the beginning of request, then saves is back to the store with possible changes applied by host rack application. This way the session becomes to be a subject of race conditions in general sense over concurrent rack requests. When using the `Rack::Session::Pool` middleware, and provided the attacker can acquire a session cookie (already a major issue), the session may be restored if the attacker can trigger a long running request (within that same session) adjacent to the user logging out, in order to retain illicit access even after a user has attempted to logout. Version 2.2.14 contains a patch for the issue. Some other mitigations are available. Either ensure the application invalidates sessions atomically by marking them as logged out e.g., using a `logged_out` flag, instead of deleting them, and check this flag on every request to prevent reuse; or implement a custom session store that tracks session invalidation timestamps and refuses to accept session data if the session was invalidated after the request began.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-32441'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-32441</a>

A minor issue allowed third-party websites to access the server's secondary authentication bridge, potentially revealing basic student information (name and number). However, the issue posed minimal risk, was never exploited, and had limited impact. A fix was implemented promptly on May 3, 2025.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-46826'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-46826</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-46821</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-05-07 22:15:21<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Envoy is a cloud-native edge/middle/service proxy. Prior to versions 1.34.1, 1.33.3, 1.32.6, and 1.31.8, Envoy's URI template matcher incorrectly excludes the `*` character from a set of valid characters in the URI path. As a result URI path containing the `*` character will not match a URI template expressions. This can result in bypass of RBAC rules when configured using the `uri_template` permissions. This vulnerability is fixed in Envoy versions v1.34.1, v1.33.3, v1.32.6, v1.31.8. As a workaround, configure additional RBAC permissions using `url_path` with `safe_regex` expression.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-46821'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-46821</a>
