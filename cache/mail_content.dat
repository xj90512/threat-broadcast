<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-56512</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-12-28 17:15:07<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Apache NiFi 1.10.0 through 2.0.0 are missing fine-grained authorization checking for Parameter Contexts, referenced Controller Services, and referenced Parameter Providers, when creating new Process Groups. Creating a new Process Group can include binding to a Parameter Context, but in cases where the Process Group did not reference any Parameter values, the framework did not check user authorization for the bound Parameter Context. Missing authorization for a bound Parameter Context enabled clients to download non-sensitive Parameter values after creating the Process Group. Creating a new Process Group can also include referencing existing Controller Services or Parameter Providers. The framework did not check user authorization for referenced Controller Services or Parameter Providers, enabling clients to create Process Groups and use these components that were otherwise unauthorized. This vulnerability is limited in scope to authenticated users authorized to create Process Groups. The scope is further limited to deployments with component-based authorization policies. Upgrading to Apache NiFi 2.1.0 is the recommended mitigation, which includes authorization checking for Parameter and Controller Service references on Process Group creation.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-56512'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-56512</a>

In igen6_probe(), igen6_pvt will be allocated with kzalloc() 2. In igen6_register_mci(), mci->pvt_info will point to &igen6_pvt->imc[mc] During rmmod: 1. In mci_release() in edac_mc.c, it will kfree(mci->pvt_info) 2. In igen6_remove(), it will kfree(igen6_pvt); Fix this issue by setting mci->pvt_info to NULL to avoid the double kfree.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-56708'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-56708</a>

After reservation of the PMU hardware the memory required for the PMUs the event is to be installed on is allocated by allocate_buffers() and alloc_sampling_buffer(). This done outside of the mutex protection. Without mutex protection two or more concurrent invocations of perf_event_init() may run in parallel. This can lead to allocation of Sample Data Blocks (SDBs) multiple times for the same PMU. Prevent this and protect memory allocation of SDBs by mutex.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-56706'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-56706</a>
