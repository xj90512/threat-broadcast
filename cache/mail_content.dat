<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-46647</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-07-02 12:15:28<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability of plugin openid-connect in Apache APISIX. This vulnerability will only have an impact if all of the following conditions are met: 1. Use the openid-connect plugin with introspection mode 2. The auth service connected to openid-connect provides services to multiple issuers 3. Multiple issuers share the same private key and relies only on the issuer being different If affected by this vulnerability, it would allow an attacker with a valid account on one of the issuers to log into the other issuer. This issue affects Apache APISIX: until 3.12.0. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.12.0 or higher.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-46647'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-46647</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-35164</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-07-02 12:15:27<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The terminal emulator of Apache Guacamole 1.5.5 and older does not properly validate console codes received from servers via text-based protocols like SSH. If a malicious user has access to a text-based connection, a specially-crafted sequence of console codes could allow arbitrary code to be executed with the privileges of the running guacd process. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.6.0, which fixes this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-35164'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-35164</a>

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-4946</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-07-02 10:15:23<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The Vikinger theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the vikinger_delete_activity_media_ajax() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.32. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php). Note: Requires Vikinger Media plugin to be installed and active.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-4946'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-4946</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-2330</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-07-02 10:15:23<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The All-in-One Addons for Elementor – WidgetKit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'button+modal' widget in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-2330'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-2330</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-27025</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-07-02 10:15:22<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The target device exposes a service on a specific TCP port with a configured endpoint. The access to that endpoint is granted using a Basic Authentication method. The endpoint accepts also the PUT method and it is possible to write files on the target device file system. Files are written as root. Using Postman it is possible to perform a Directory Traversal attack and write files into any location of the device file system. Similarly to the PUT method, it is possible to leverage the same mechanism to read any file from the file system by using the GET method.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-27025'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-27025</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-27024</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-07-02 10:15:22<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Unrestricted access to OS file system in SFTP service in Infinera G42 version R6.1.3 allows remote authenticated users to read/write OS files via SFTP connections. Details: Account members of the Network Administrator profile can access the target machine via SFTP with the same credentials used for SSH CLI access and are able to read all files according to the OS permission instead of remaining inside the chrooted directory position.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-27024'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-27024</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-27023</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-07-02 10:15:22<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Lack or insufficent input validation in WebGUI CLI web in Infinera G42 version R6.1.3 allows remote authenticated users to read all OS files via crafted CLI commands. Details: The web interface based management of the Infinera G42 appliance enables the feature of executing a restricted set of commands. This feature also offers the option to execute a script-file already present on the target device. When a non-script or incorrect file is specified, the content of the file is shown along with an error message. Due to an execution of the http service with a privileged user all files on the file system can be viewed this way.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-27023'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-27023</a>

Details: Lack or insufficient validation of user-supplied input allows authenticated users to access all files on the target machine file system that are readable to the user account used to run the httpd service.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-27022'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-27022</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-27021</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-07-02 09:15:25<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The misconfiguration in the sudoers configuration of the operating system in Infinera G42 version R6.1.3 allows low privileged OS users to read/write physical memory via devmem command line tool. This could allow sensitive information disclosure, denial of service, and privilege escalation by tampering with kernel memory. Details: The output of "sudo -l" reports the presence of "devmem" command executable as super user without using a password. This command allows to read and write an arbitrary memory area of the target device, specifying an absolute address.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-27021'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-27021</a>
