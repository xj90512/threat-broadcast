<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-28059</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-04-18 17:15:34<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] An access control vulnerability in Nagios Network Analyzer 2024R1.0.3 allows deleted users to retain access to system resources due to improper session invalidation and stale token handling. When an administrator deletes a user account, the backend fails to terminate active sessions and revoke associated API tokens, enabling unauthorized access to restricted functions.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-28059'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-28059</a>

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-32796</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-04-18 16:15:23<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Dify is an open-source LLM app development platform. Prior to version 0.6.12, a vulnerability was identified in the DIFY where normal users can enable or disable apps through the API, even though the web UI button for this action is disabled and normal users are not permitted to make such changes. This access control flaw allows non-admin users to make unauthorized changes, which can disrupt the functionality and availability of the APPS. This issue has been patched in version 0.6.12. A workaround for this vulnerability involves updating the API access control mechanisms to enforce stricter user role permissions and implementing role-based access controls (RBAC) to ensure that only users with admin privileges can send enable or disable requests for apps.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-32796'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-32796</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-32795</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-04-18 16:15:23<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Dify is an open-source LLM app development platform. Prior to version 0.6.12, a vulnerability was identified in the DIFY where normal users are improperly granted permissions to edit APP names, descriptions and icons. This access control flaw allows non-admin users to modify app details, despite being restricted from viewing apps, which poses a security risk to the integrity of the application. This issue has been patched in version 0.6.12. A workaround for this vulnerability involves updating the access control mechanisms to enforce stricter user role permissions and implementing role-based access controls (RBAC) to ensure that only users with admin privileges can modify app details.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-32795'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-32795</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-32792</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-04-18 16:04:16<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] SES safely executes third-party JavaScript 'strict' mode programs in compartments that have no excess authority in their global scope. Prior to version 1.12.0, web pages and web extensions using `ses` and the Compartment API to evaluate third-party code in an isolated execution environment that have also elsewhere used `const`, `let`, and `class` bindings in the top-level scope of a `<script>` tag will have inadvertently revealed these bindings in the lexical scope of third-party code. This issue has been patched in version 1.12.0. Workarounds for this issue involve either avoiding top-level `let`, `const`, or `class` bindings in `<script>` tags, or change these to `var` bindings to be reflected on `globalThis`.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-32792'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-32792</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-32442</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-04-18 15:59:06<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Fastify is a fast and low overhead web framework, for Node.js. In versions 5.0.0 to 5.3.0, applications that specify different validation strategies for different content types have a possibility to bypass validation by providing a _slightly altered_ content type such as with different casing or altered whitespacing before `;`. This issue has been patched in version 5.3.1. A workaround involves not specifying individual content types in the schema.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-32442'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-32442</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-32389</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-04-18 15:56:39<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] NamelessMC is a free, easy to use & powerful website software for Minecraft servers. Prior to version 2.1.4, NamelessMC is vulnerable to SQL injection by providing an unexpected square bracket GET parameter syntax. Square bracket GET parameter syntax refers to the structure `?param[0]=a&param[1]=b&param[2]=c` utilized by PHP, which is parsed by PHP as `$_GET['param']` being of type array. This issue has been patched in version 2.1.4.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-32389'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-32389</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-31120</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-04-18 15:52:57<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] NamelessMC is a free, easy to use & powerful website software for Minecraft servers. In version 2.1.4 and prior, an insecure view count mechanism in the forum page allows an unauthenticated attacker to artificially increase the view count. The application relies on a client-side cookie (nl-topic-[tid]) (or session variable for guests) to determine if a view should be counted. When a client does not provide the cookie, every page request increments the counter, leading to incorrect view metrics. This issue has been patched in version 2.2.0.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-31120'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-31120</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-31118</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-04-18 15:52:36<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] NamelessMC is a free, easy to use & powerful website software for Minecraft servers. In version 2.1.4 and prior, forum quick reply feature (view_topic.php) does not implement any spam prevention mechanism. This allows authenticated users to continuously post replies without any time restriction, resulting in an uncontrolled surge of posts that can disrupt normal operations. This issue has been patched in version 2.2.0.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-31118'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-31118</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-30357</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-04-18 15:51:21<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] NamelessMC is a free, easy to use & powerful website software for Minecraft servers. In version 2.1.4 and prior, if a malicious user is leaving spam comments on many topics then an administrator, unable to manually remove each spam comment, may delete the malicious account. Once an administrator deletes the malicious user's account, all their posts (comments) along with the associated topics (by unrelated users) will be marked as deleted.
