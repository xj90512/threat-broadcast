Specifically, older versions store agent registration data as bytes, whereas the updated registrar expects str. This issue leads to an exception when processing agent registration requests, causing the agent to fail.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-1057'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-1057</a>
