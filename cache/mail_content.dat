<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-32428</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-04-15 00:15:14<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Jupyter Remote Desktop Proxy allows you to run a Linux Desktop on a JupyterHub. jupyter-remote-desktop-proxy was meant to rely on UNIX sockets readable only by the current user since version 3.0.0, but when used with TigerVNC, the VNC server started by jupyter-remote-desktop-proxy were still accessible via the network. This vulnerability does not affect users having TurboVNC as the vncserver executable. This issue is fixed in 3.0.1.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-32428'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-32428</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-31494</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-04-15 00:15:14<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] AutoGPT is a platform that allows users to create, deploy, and manage continuous artificial intelligence agents that automate complex workflows. The AutoGPT Platform's WebSocket API transmitted node execution updates to subscribers based on the graph_id+graph_version. Additionally, there was no check prohibiting users from subscribing with another user's graph_id+graph_version. As a result, node execution updates from one user's graph execution could be received by another user within the same instance. This vulnerability does not occur between different instances or between users and non-users of the platform. Single-user instances are not affected. In private instances with a user white-list, the impact is limited by the fact that all potential unintended recipients of these node execution updates must have been admitted by the administrator. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.6.1.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-31494'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-31494</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-31491</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-04-15 00:15:14<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] AutoGPT is a platform that allows users to create, deploy, and manage continuous artificial intelligence agents that automate complex workflows. Prior to 0.6.1, AutoGPT allows of leakage of cross-domain cookies and protected headers in requests redirect. AutoGPT uses a wrapper around the requests python library, located in autogpt_platform/backend/backend/util/request.py. In this wrapper, redirects are specifically NOT followed for the first request. If the wrapper is used with allow_redirects set to True (which is the default), any redirect is not followed by the initial request, but rather re-requested by the wrapper using the new location. However, there is a fundamental flaw in manually re-requesting the new location: it does not account for security-sensitive headers which should not be sent cross-origin, such as the Authorization and Proxy-Authorization header, and cookies. For example in autogpt_platform/backend/backend/blocks/github/_api.py, an Authorization header is set when retrieving data from the GitHub API. However, if GitHub suffers from an open redirect vulnerability (such as the made-up example of https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/comments/{comment_id}/../../../../../redirect/?url=https://joshua.hu/), and the script can be coerced into visiting it with the Authorization header, the GitHub credentials in the Authorization header will be leaked. This allows leaking auth headers and private cookies. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.6.1.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-31491'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-31491</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-24797</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-04-15 00:15:14<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Meshtastic is an open source mesh networking solution. A fault in the handling of mesh packets containing invalid protobuf data can result in an attacker-controlled buffer overflow, allowing an attacker to hijack execution flow, potentially resulting in remote code execution. This attack does not require authentication or user interaction, as long as the target device rebroadcasts packets on the default channel. This vulnerability fixed in 2.6.2.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-24797'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-24797</a>

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-31490</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-04-14 23:15:21<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] AutoGPT is a platform that allows users to create, deploy, and manage continuous artificial intelligence agents that automate complex workflows. Prior to 0.6.1, AutoGPT allows SSRF due to DNS Rebinding in requests wrapper. AutoGPT is built with a wrapper around Python's requests library, hardening the application against SSRF. The code for this wrapper can be found in autogpt_platform/backend/backend/util/request.py. The requested hostname of a URL which is being requested is validated, ensuring that it does not resolve to any local ipv4 or ipv6 addresses. However, this check is not sufficient, as a DNS server may initially respond with a non-blocked address, with a TTL of 0. This means that the initial resolution would appear as a non-blocked address. In this case, validate_url() will return the url as successful. After validate_url() has successfully returned the url, the url is then passed to the real request() function. When the real request() function is called with the validated url, request() will once again resolve the address of the hostname, because the record will not have been cached (due to TTL 0). This resolution may be in the "invalid range". This type of attack is called a "DNS Rebinding Attack". This vulnerability is fixed in 0.6.1.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-31490'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-31490</a>
