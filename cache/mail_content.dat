<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-8452</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-08-12 16:15:29<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] By using the "uscan" protocol provided by the eSCL specification, an attacker can discover the serial number of multi-function printers that implement the Brother-provided firmware. This serial number can, in turn, can be leveraged by the flaw described by CVE-2024-51978 to calculate the default administrator password. This flaw is similar to CVE-2024-51977, with the only difference being the protocol by which an attacker can use to learn the remote device's serial number. The eSCL/uscan vector is typically only exposed on the local network. Any discovery service that implements the eSCL specification can be used to exploit this vulnerability, and one such implementation is the runZero Explorer. Changing the default administrator password will render this vulnerability virtually worthless, since the calculated default administrator password would no longer be the correct password.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-8452'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-8452</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-55164</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-08-12 16:15:29<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] content-security-policy-parser parses content security policy directives. A prototype pollution vulnerability exists in versions 0.5.0 and earlier, wherein if a policy name is called __proto__, one can override the Object prototype. This issue has been patched in version 0.6.0. A workaround involves disabling prototype method in NodeJS, neutralizing all possible prototype pollution attacks. Provide either --disable-proto=delete (recommended) or --disable-proto=throw as an argument to node to enable this feature.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-55164'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-55164</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-55011</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-08-12 16:15:28<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Kanboard is project management software that focuses on the Kanban methodology. Prior to version 1.2.47, the createTaskFile method in the API does not validate whether the task_id parameter is a valid task id, nor does it check for path traversal. As a result, a malicious actor could write a file anywhere on the system the app user controls. The impact is limited due to the filename being hashed and having no extension. This issue has been patched in version 1.2.47.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-55011'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-55011</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-55010</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-08-12 16:15:28<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Kanboard is project management software that focuses on the Kanban methodology. Prior to version 1.2.47, an unsafe deserialization vulnerability in the ProjectEventActvityFormatter allows admin users the ability to instantiate arbitrary php objects by modifying the event["data"] field in the project_activities table. A malicious actor can update this field to use a php gadget to write a web shell into the /plugins folder, which then gives remote code execution on the host system. This issue has been patched in version 1.2.47.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-55010'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-55010</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-54864</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-08-12 16:15:28<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Hydra is a continuous integration service for Nix based projects. Prior to commit f7bda02, /api/push-github and /api/push-gitea are called by the corresponding forge without HTTP Basic authentication. Both forges do however feature HMAC signing with a secret key. Triggering an evaluation can be very taxing on the infrastructure when large evaluations are done, introducing potential denial of service attacks on the host running the evaluator. This issue has been patched by commit f7bda02. A workaround involves blocking /api/push-github and /api/push-gitea via a reverse proxy.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-54864'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-54864</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-54800</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-08-12 16:15:28<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Hydra is a continuous integration service for Nix based projects. Prior to commit dea1e16, a malicious package can introduce arbitrary JavaScript code into the Hydra database that is automatically evaluated in a client's browser when anyone visits the build page. This could be done by a third-party project as part of its build process. This also happens in other places like with hydra-release-name. This issue has been patched by commit dea1e16. A workaround involves either not building untrusted packages or not visiting the builds page.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-54800'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-54800</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-38500</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-08-12 16:15:27<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: xfrm: interface: fix use-after-free after changing collect_md xfrm interface collect_md property on xfrm interfaces can only be set on device creation, thus xfrmi_changelink() should fail when called on such interfaces. The check to enforce this was done only in the case where the xi was returned from xfrmi_locate() which doesn't look for the collect_md interface, and thus the validation was never reached. Calling changelink would thus errornously place the special interface xi in the xfrmi_net->xfrmi hash, but since it also exists in the xfrmi_net->collect_md_xfrmi pointer it would lead to a double free when the net namespace was taken down [1]. Change the check to use the xi from netdev_priv which is available earlier in the function to prevent changes in xfrm collect_md interfaces.
