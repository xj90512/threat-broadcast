<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-35932</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-06-23 22:15:08 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] jcvi is a Python library to facilitate genome assembly, annotation, and comparative genomics. A configuration injection happens when user input is considered by the application in an unsanitized format and can reach the configuration file. A malicious user may craft a special payload that may lead to a command injection. The impact of a configuration injection may vary. Under some conditions, it may lead to command injection if there is for instance shell code execution from the configuration file values. This vulnerability does not currently have a fix.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-35932'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-35932</a>

In NextCloud Server versions 25.0.0 until 25.0.7 and 26.0.0 until 26.0.2 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server versions 19.0.0 until 19.0.13.9, 20.0.0 until 20.0.14.14, 21.0.0 until 21.0.9.12, 22.0.0 until 22.2.10.12, 23.0.0 until 23.0.12.7, 24.0.0 until 24.0.12.2, 25.0.0 until 25.0.7, and 26.0.0 until 26.0.2, a user could use this functionality to get access to the login credentials of another user and take over their account. This issue has been patched in Nextcloud Server versions 25.0.7 and 26.0.2 and NextCloud Enterprise Server versions 19.0.13.9, 20.0.14.14, 21.0.9.12, 22.2.10.12, 23.0.12.7, 24.0.12.2, 25.0.7, and 26.0.2.Three workarounds are available. Disable app files_external. Change config setting &quot;Allow users to mount external storage&quot; to disabled in &quot;Administration&quot; &gt; &quot;External storage&quot; settings `&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;/index.php/settings/admin/externalstorages`. Change config setting to disallow users to create external storages in &quot;Administration&quot; &gt; &quot;External storage&quot; settings `&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;/index.php/settings/admin/externalstorages` with the types FTP, Nextcloud, SFTP, and/or WebDAV.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-35928'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-35928</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] 美国国家漏洞数据库（NVD）<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-35927</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-06-23 21:15:09 <br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] NextCloud Server and NextCloud Enterprise Server provide file storage for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity platform. In NextCloud Server versions 25.0.0 until 25.0.7 and 26.0.0 until 26.0.2 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server versions 21.0.0 until 21.0.9.12, 22.0.0 until 22.2.10.12, 23.0.0 until 23.0.12.7, 24.0.0 until 24.0.12.2, 25.0.0 until 25.0.7, and 26.0.0 until 26.0.2, when two server are registered as trusted servers for each other and successfully exchanged the share secrets, the malicious server could modify or delete VCards in the system addressbook on the origin server. This would impact the available and shown information in certain places, such as the user search and avatar menu. If a manipulated user modifies their own data in the personal settings the entry is fixed again.Nextcloud Server n 25.0.7 and 26.0.2 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server 21.0.9.12, 22.2.10.12, 23.0.12.7, 24.0.12.2, 25.0.7, and 26.0.2 contain a patch for this issue. A workaround is available. Remove all trusted servers in the &quot;Administration&quot; &gt; &quot;Sharing&quot; settings `&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;/index.php/settings/admin/sharing`. Afterwards, trigger a recreation of the local system addressbook with the following `occ dav:sync-system-addressbook`.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-35927'>https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-35927</a>
