<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-34132</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-07-16 21:26:51<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A command injection vulnerability exists in LILIN Digital Video Recorder (DVR) devices prior to firmware version 2.0b60_20200207 via the Server field in the NTPUpdate configuration. The web service at /z/zbin/dvr_box fails to properly sanitize input, allowing remote attackers to inject and execute arbitrary commands as root by supplying specially crafted XML data to the DVRPOST interface. 777<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-34132'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-34132</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-34130</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-07-16 21:26:42<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] An unauthenticated arbitrary file read exists in LILIN Digital Video Recorder (DVR) devices prior to firmware version 2.0b60_20200207 via the /z/zbin/net_html.cgi endpoint. This vulnerability allows attackers to read sensitive configuration files, such as /zconf/service.xml, which can then be used to facilitate further attacks including command injection. The vulnerability has been exploited in the wild in conjunction with other issues by botnets like FBot and Moobot.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-34130'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-34130</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-34129</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-07-16 21:26:32<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A command injection vulnerability exists in LILIN LILIN Digital Video Recorder (DVR) devices prior to firmware version 2.0b60_20200207 due to insufficient sanitization of the FTP and NTP Server fields in the service configuration. An attacker with access to the configuration interface can upload a malicious XML file with injected shell commands in these fields. Upon subsequent configuration syncs, these commands are executed with elevated privileges. This vulnerability was exploited in the wild by the Moobot botnets.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-34129'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-34129</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-34123</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-07-16 21:15:27<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in VideoCharge Studio 2.12.3.685 when processing a specially crafted .VSC configuration file. The issue occurs due to improper handling of user-supplied data in the XML 'Name' attribute, leading to an SEH overwrite condition. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to open a malicious .VSC file, resulting in arbitrary code execution under the context of the user.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-34123'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-34123</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-34121</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-07-16 21:15:27<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] An unauthenticated arbitrary file upload vulnerability exists in Idera Up.Time Monitoring Station versions up to and including 7.2. The `wizards/post2file.php` script accepts arbitrary POST parameters, allowing attackers to upload crafted PHP files to the webroot. Successful exploitation results in remote code execution as the web server user. NOTE: The bypass for this vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2015-9263.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-34121'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-34121</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-34120</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-07-16 21:15:26<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] An unauthenticated file download vulnerability exists in LimeSurvey versions from 2.0+ up to and including 2.06+ Build 151014. The application fails to validate serialized input to the admin backup endpoint (`index.php/admin/update/sa/backup`), allowing attackers to specify arbitrary file paths using a crafted `datasupdateinfo` payload. The files are packaged in a ZIP archive and made available for download without authentication. This vulnerability can be exploited to read arbitrary files on the host system, including sensitive OS and configuration files.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-34120'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-34120</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-34119</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-07-16 21:15:26<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A remote file disclosure vulnerability exists in EasyCafe Server 2.2.14, exploitable by unauthenticated remote attackers via TCP port 831. The server listens for a custom protocol where opcode 0x43 can be used to request arbitrary files by absolute path. If the file exists and is accessible, its content is returned without authentication. This flaw allows attackers to retrieve sensitive files such as system configuration, password files, or application data.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-34119'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-34119</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-34118</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-07-16 21:15:26<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A path traversal vulnerability exists in Linknat VOS Manager versions prior to 2.1.9.07, including VOS2009 and early VOS3000 builds, that allows unauthenticated remote attackers to read arbitrary files on the server. The vulnerability is accessible via multiple localized subpaths such as '/eng/', '/chs/', or '/cht/', where the 'js/lang_en_us.js' or equivalent files are loaded. By injecting encoded traversal sequences such as '%c0%ae%c0%ae' into the request path, attackers can bypass input validation and disclose sensitive files.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-34118'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-34118</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-34117</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-07-16 21:15:26<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A remote code execution vulnerability exists in multiple Netcore and Netis routers models with firmware released prior to August 2014 due to the presence of an undocumented backdoor listener on UDP port 53413. Exact version boundaries remain undocumented. An unauthenticated remote attacker can send specially crafted UDP packets to execute arbitrary commands on the affected device. This backdoor uses a hardcoded authentication mechanism and accepts shell commands post-authentication. Some device models include a non-standard implementation of the `echo` command, which may affect exploitability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-34117'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-34117</a>
