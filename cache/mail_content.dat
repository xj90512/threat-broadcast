<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-4785</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-09-13 17:15:10<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Lack of error handling in the TCP server in Google's gRPC starting version 1.23 on posix-compatible platforms (ex. Linux) allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by initiating a significant number of connections with the server. Note that gRPC C++ Python, and Ruby are affected, but gRPC Java, and Go are NOT affected.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-4785'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-4785</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-4155</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-09-13 17:15:10<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A flaw was found in KVM AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) in the Linux kernel. A KVM guest using SEV-ES or SEV-SNP with multiple vCPUs can trigger a double fetch race condition vulnerability and invoke the `VMGEXIT` handler recursively. If an attacker manages to call the handler multiple times, they can trigger a stack overflow and cause a denial of service or potentially guest-to-host escape in kernel configurations without stack guard pages (`CONFIG_VMAP_STACK`).<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-4155'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-4155</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-3301</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-09-13 17:15:10<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A flaw was found in QEMU. The async nature of hot-unplug enables a race scenario where the net device backend is cleared before the virtio-net pci frontend has been unplugged. A malicious guest could use this time window to trigger an assertion and cause a denial of service.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-3301'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-3301</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-3280</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-09-13 17:15:09<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A problem with a protection mechanism in the Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR agent on Windows devices allows a local user to disable the agent.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-3280'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-3280</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-3255</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-09-13 17:15:09<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A flaw was found in the QEMU built-in VNC server while processing ClientCutText messages. A wrong exit condition may lead to an infinite loop when inflating an attacker controlled zlib buffer in the `inflate_buffer` function. This could allow a remote authenticated client who is able to send a clipboard to the VNC server to trigger a denial of service.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-3255'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-3255</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-2680</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-09-13 17:15:09<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] This CVE exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-3750. More specifically, the qemu-kvm package as released for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.1 via RHSA-2022:7967 included a version of qemu-kvm that was actually missing the fix for CVE-2021-3750.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-2680'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-2680</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-20236</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-09-13 17:15:09<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the iPXE boot function of Cisco IOS XR software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to install an unverified software image on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient image verification. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the boot parameters for image verification during the iPXE boot process on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to boot an unverified software image on the affected device.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-20236'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-20236</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-20233</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-09-13 17:15:09<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) feature of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of invalid continuity check messages (CCMs). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted CCMs to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the CFM service to crash when a user displays information about maintenance end points (MEPs) for peer MEPs on an affected device.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-20233'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-20233</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-20191</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-09-13 17:15:09<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the access control list (ACL) processing on MPLS interfaces in the ingress direction of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured ACL. This vulnerability is due to incomplete support for this feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to send traffic through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass an ACL on the affected device. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability. This advisory is part of the September 2023 release of the Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication.

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-20190</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-09-13 17:15:09<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the classic access control list (ACL) compression feature of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass the protection that is offered by a configured ACL on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to incorrect destination address range encoding in the compression module of an ACL that is applied to an interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending traffic through the affected device that should be denied by the configured ACL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured ACL protections on the affected device, allowing the attacker to access trusted networks that the device might be protecting. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability. This advisory is part of the September 2023 release of the Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication.
