<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-1474</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-02-21 16:15:49<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] In WS_FTP Server versions before 8.8.5, reflected cross-site scripting issues have been identified on various user supplied inputs on the WS_FTP Server administrative interface.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-1474'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-1474</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-49100</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-02-21 16:15:49<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Trusted Firmware-A (TF-A) before 2.10 has a potential read out-of-bounds in the SDEI service. The input parameter passed in register x1 is not validated well enough in the function sdei_interrupt_bind. The parameter is passed to a call to plat_ic_get_interrupt_type. It can be any arbitrary value passing checks in the function plat_ic_is_sgi. A compromised Normal World (Linux kernel) can enable a root-privileged attacker to issue arbitrary SMC calls. Using this primitive, he can control the content of registers x0 through x6, which are used to send parameters to TF-A. Out-of-bounds addresses can be read in the context of TF-A (EL3). Because the read value is never returned to non-secure memory or in registers, no leak is possible. An attacker can still crash TF-A, however.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-49100'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-49100</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-46241</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-02-21 16:15:49<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] `discourse-microsoft-auth` is a plugin that enables authentication via Microsoft. On sites with the `discourse-microsoft-auth` plugin enabled, an attack can potentially take control of a victim's Discourse account. Sites that have configured their application's account type to any options other than `Accounts in this organizational directory only (O365 only - Single tenant)` are vulnerable. This vulnerability has been patched in commit c40665f44509724b64938c85def9fb2e79f62ec8 of `discourse-microsoft-auth`. A `microsoft_auth:revoke` rake task has also been added which will deactivate and log out all users that have connected their accounts to Microsoft. User API keys as well as API keys created by those users will also be revoked. The rake task will also remove the connection records to Microsoft for those users. This will allow affected users to re-verify their account emails as well as reconnect their Discourse account to Microsoft for authentication. As a workaround, disable the `discourse-microsoft-auth` plugin by setting the `microsoft_auth_enabled` site setting to `false`. Run the `microsoft_auth:log_out_users` rake task to log out all users with associated Microsoft accounts.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-46241'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-46241</a>

A basic XSS vulnerability exists under the /api/v1/vdeskintegration/todo/createorupdate endpoint via the title parameter and /dashboard/reminders. A remote user (authenticated to the product) can store arbitrary HTML code in the reminder section title in order to corrupt the web page (for example, by creating phishing sections to exfiltrate victims' credentials).<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-45179'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2022-45179</a>
