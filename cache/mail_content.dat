<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-3177</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-04-22 23:15:51<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A security issue was discovered in Kubernetes where users may be able to launch containers that bypass the mountable secrets policy enforced by the ServiceAccount admission plugin when using containers, init containers, and ephemeral containers with the envFrom field populated. The policy ensures pods running with a service account may only reference secrets specified in the service account’s secrets field. Kubernetes clusters are only affected if the ServiceAccount admission plugin and the kubernetes.io/enforce-mountable-secrets annotation are used together with containers, init containers, and ephemeral containers with the envFrom field populated.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-3177'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-3177</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-32657</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-04-22 23:15:50<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Hydra is a Continuous Integration service for Nix based projects. Attackers can execute arbitrary code in the browser context of Hydra and execute authenticated HTTP requests. The abused feature allows Nix builds to specify files that Hydra serves to clients. One use of this functionality is serving NixOS `.iso` files. The issue is only with html files served by Hydra. The issue has been patched on https://hydra.nixos.org around 2024-04-21 14:30 UTC. The nixpkgs package were fixed in unstable and 23.11. Users with custom Hydra packages can apply the fix commit to their local installations. The vulnerability is only triggered when opening HTML build artifacts, so not opening them until the vulnerability is fixed works around the issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-32657'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-32657</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-32656</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-04-22 23:15:50<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Ant Media Server is live streaming engine software. A local privilege escalation vulnerability in present in versions 2.6.0 through 2.8.2 allows any unprivileged operating system user account to escalate privileges to the root user account on the system. This vulnerability arises from Ant Media Server running with Java Management Extensions (JMX) enabled and authentication disabled on localhost on port 5599/TCP. This vulnerability is nearly identical to the local privilege escalation vulnerability CVE-2023-26269 identified in Apache James. Any unprivileged operating system user can connect to the JMX service running on port 5599/TCP on localhost and leverage the MLet Bean within JMX to load a remote MBean from an attacker-controlled server. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the Java process run by Ant Media Server and execute code within the context of the `antmedia` service account on the system. Version 2.9.0 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, one may remove certain parameters from the `antmedia.service` file.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-32656'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-32656</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-32653</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-04-22 23:15:50<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] jadx is a Dex to Java decompiler. Prior to version 1.5.0, the package name is not filtered before concatenation. This can be exploited to inject arbitrary code into the package name. The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute commands with shell privileges. Version 1.5.0 contains a patch for the vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-32653'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-32653</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-32480</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-04-22 23:15:50<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] LibreNMS is an open-source, PHP/MySQL/SNMP-based network monitoring system. Versions prior to 24.4.0 are vulnerable to SQL injection. The `order` parameter is obtained from `$request`. After performing a string check, the value is directly incorporated into an SQL statement and concatenated, resulting in a SQL injection vulnerability. An attacker may extract a whole database this way. Version 24.4.0 fixes the issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-32480'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-32480</a>

Prior to version 24.4.0, there is improper sanitization on the `Service` template name, which can lead to stored Cross-site Scripting. Version 24.4.0 fixes this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-32479'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-32479</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-32461</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-04-22 22:15:07<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] LibreNMS is an open-source, PHP/MySQL/SNMP-based network monitoring system. A SQL injection vulnerability in POST /search/search=packages in LibreNMS prior to version 24.4.0 allows a user with global read privileges to execute SQL commands via the package parameter. With this vulnerability, an attacker can exploit a SQL injection time based vulnerability to extract all data from the database, such as administrator credentials. Version 24.4.0 contains a patch for the vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-32461'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-32461</a>

FreeRDP based based clients using `/bpp:32` legacy `GDI` drawing path with a version of FreeRDP prior to 3.5.0 or 2.11.6 are vulnerable to out-of-bounds read. Versions 3.5.0 and 2.11.6 patch the issue. As a workaround, use modern drawing paths (e.g. `/rfx` or `/gfx` options). The workaround requires server side support.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-32460'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-32460</a>
