This issue only impacts SoftIron HyperCloud and related software products (such as VM Squared) software versions 2.3.0 to before 2.5.0.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-13058'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-13058</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-13051</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-12-30 21:15:07<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Ashlar-Vellum Graphite VC6 File Parsing Heap-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Ashlar-Vellum Graphite. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of VC6 files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.
