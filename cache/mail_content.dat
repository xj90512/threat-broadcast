<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-37889</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-05-09 07:16:10<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: PCI/MSI: Handle the NOMASK flag correctly for all PCI/MSI backends The conversion of the XEN specific global variable pci_msi_ignore_mask to a MSI domain flag, missed the facts that: 1) Legacy architectures do not provide a interrupt domain 2) Parent MSI domains do not necessarily have a domain info attached Both cases result in an unconditional NULL pointer dereference. This was unfortunatly missed in review and testing revealed it late. Cure this by using the existing pci_msi_domain_supports() helper, which handles all possible cases correctly.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-37889'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-37889</a>

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-37887</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-05-09 07:16:10<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: pds_core: handle unsupported PDS_CORE_CMD_FW_CONTROL result If the FW doesn't support the PDS_CORE_CMD_FW_CONTROL command the driver might at the least print garbage and at the worst crash when the user runs the "devlink dev info" devlink command. This happens because the stack variable fw_list is not 0 initialized which results in fw_list.num_fw_slots being a garbage value from the stack. Then the driver tries to access fw_list.fw_names[i] with i >= ARRAY_SIZE and runs off the end of the array. Fix this by initializing the fw_list and by not failing completely if the devcmd fails because other useful information is printed via devlink dev info even if the devcmd fails.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-37887'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-37887</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-3605</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-05-09 07:16:10<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The Frontend Login and Registration Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.7. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their details like email via the flr_blocks_user_settings_handle_ajax_callback() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's email addresses, including administrators, and leverage that to reset the user's password and gain access to their account.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-3605'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-3605</a>

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-3455'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-3455</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-37886</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-05-09 07:16:09<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: pds_core: make wait_context part of q_info Make the wait_context a full part of the q_info struct rather than a stack variable that goes away after pdsc_adminq_post() is done so that the context is still available after the wait loop has given up. There was a case where a slow development firmware caused the adminq request to time out, but then later the FW finally finished the request and sent the interrupt. The handler tried to complete_all() the completion context that had been created on the stack in pdsc_adminq_post() but no longer existed. This caused bad pointer usage, kernel crashes, and much wailing and gnashing of teeth.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-37886'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-37886</a>
