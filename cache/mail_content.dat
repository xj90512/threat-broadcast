Anyone leveraging the `SignedHttpRequest`protocol or the `SignedHttpRequestValidator`is vulnerable. Microsoft.IdentityModel trusts the `jku`claim by default for the `SignedHttpRequest`protocol. This raises the possibility to make any remote or local `HTTP GET` request. The vulnerability has been fixed in Microsoft.IdentityModel.Protocols.SignedHttpRequest. Users should update all their Microsoft.IdentityModel versions to 7.1.2 (for 7x) or higher, 6.34.0 (for 6x) or higher.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-21643'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-21643</a>
