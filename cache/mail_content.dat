<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-10492</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-11-25 08:15:08<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability was found in Keycloak. A user with high privileges could read sensitive information from a Vault file that is not within the expected context. This attacker must have previous high access to the Keycloak server in order to perform resource creation, for example, an LDAP provider configuration and set up a Vault read file, which will only inform whether that file exists or not.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-10492'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-10492</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-10451</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-11-25 07:37:05<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A flaw was found in Keycloak. This issue occurs because sensitive runtime values, such as passwords, may be captured during the Keycloak build process and embedded as default values in bytecode, leading to unintended information disclosure. In Keycloak 26, sensitive data specified directly in environment variables during the build process is also stored as a default values, making it accessible during runtime. Indirect usage of environment variables for SPI options and Quarkus properties is also vulnerable due to unconditional expansion by PropertyMapper logic, capturing sensitive data as default values in all Keycloak versions up to 26.0.2.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-10451'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-10451</a>

If untrusted data is passed to the SearchQueryUtils method, it could lead to a denial of service (DoS) scenario by exhausting system resources due to a Regex complexity.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-10270'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-10270</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-9666</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-11-25 07:29:52<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability was found in the Keycloak Server. The Keycloak Server is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack due to improper handling of proxy headers. When Keycloak is configured to accept incoming proxy headers, it may accept non-IP values, such as obfuscated identifiers, without proper validation. This issue can lead to costly DNS resolution operations, which an attacker could exploit to tie up IO threads and potentially cause a denial of service. The attacker must have access to send requests to a Keycloak instance that is configured to accept proxy headers, specifically when reverse proxies do not overwrite incoming headers, and Keycloak is configured to trust these headers.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-9666'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-9666</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-11660</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-11-25 07:00:18<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability was found in code-projects Farmacia 1.0. It has been classified as problematic. This affects an unknown part of the file usuario.php. The manipulation of the argument name leads to cross site scripting. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Other parameters might be affected as well.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-11660'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-11660</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-6538</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-11-25 06:15:12<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A flaw was found in OpenShift Console. A Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack can happen if an attacker supplies all or part of a URL to the server to query. The server is considered to be in a privileged network position and can often reach exposed services that aren't readily available to clients due to network filtering. Leveraging such an attack vector, the attacker can have an impact on other services and potentially disclose information or have other nefarious effects on the system. The /api/dev-console/proxy/internet endpoint on the OpenShit Console allows authenticated users to have the console's pod perform arbitrary and fully controlled HTTP(s) requests. The full response to these requests is returned by the endpoint. While the name of this endpoint suggests the requests are only bound to the internet, no such checks are in place. An authenticated user can therefore ask the console to perform arbitrary HTTP requests from outside the cluster to a service inside the cluster.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-6538'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-6538</a>
