<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-20313</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-04-24 21:15:46<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the OSPF version 2 (OSPFv2) feature of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause an affected device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to improper validation of OSPF updates that are processed by a device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed OSPF update to the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-20313'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-20313</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-20249</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-04-24 21:15:46<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco TelePresence Management Suite (TMS) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious data in a specific data field in the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-20249'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-20249</a>

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-4127</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-04-24 20:15:08<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability was found in Tenda W15E 15.11.0.14. It has been classified as critical. Affected is the function guestWifiRuleRefresh. The manipulation of the argument qosGuestDownstream leads to stack-based buffer overflow. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. VDB-261870 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability. NOTE: The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-4127'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-4127</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-4126</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-04-24 20:15:08<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability was found in Tenda W15E 15.11.0.14 and classified as critical. This issue affects the function formSetSysTime of the file /goform/SetSysTimeCfg. The manipulation of the argument manualTime leads to stack-based buffer overflow. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The identifier VDB-261869 was assigned to this vulnerability.

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-32879</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-04-24 20:15:07<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Python Social Auth is a social authentication/registration mechanism. Prior to version 5.4.1, due to default case-insensitive collation in MySQL or MariaDB databases, third-party authentication user IDs are not case-sensitive and could cause different IDs to match. This issue has been addressed by a fix released in version 5.4.1. An immediate workaround would be to change collation of the affected field.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-32879'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-32879</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-20358</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-04-24 20:15:07<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability in the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) restore functionality that is available in Cisco ASA Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with root-level privileges. Administrator-level privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability exists because the contents of a backup file are improperly sanitized at restore time. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by restoring a crafted backup file to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying Linux operating system as root.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-20358'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-20358</a>
