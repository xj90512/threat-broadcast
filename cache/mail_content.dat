While a nonce check is present, it is only executed if a nonce is set. By omitting a nonce from the request, the check can be bypassed.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-6520'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-6520</a>

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-21669</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-01-11 06:15:44<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py) is a foundation for building decentralized identity applications and services running in non-mobile environments. When verifying W3C Format Verifiable Credentials using JSON-LD with Linked Data Proofs (LDP-VCs), the result of verifying the presentation `document.proof` was not factored into the final `verified` value (`true`/`false`) on the presentation record. The flaw enables holders of W3C Format Verifiable Credentials using JSON-LD with Linked Data Proofs (LDPs) to present incorrectly constructed proofs, and allows malicious verifiers to save and replay a presentation from such holders as their own. This vulnerability has been present since version 0.7.0 and fixed in version 0.10.5.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-21669'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-21669</a>
