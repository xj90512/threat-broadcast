Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the component Referer Handler. The manipulation leads to server-side request forgery. The attack may be launched remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-3954'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-3954</a>

NOTE: it can be considered a user error if AWS is employed for hosting untrusted JavaScript content, but the selected architecture within AWS does not have components that are able to insert Content-Security-Policy headers.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-46655'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-46655</a>

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-46653</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-04-26 21:15:14<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Formidable (aka node-formidable) 2.1.0 through 3.x before 3.5.3 relies on hexoid to prevent guessing of filenames for untrusted executable content; however, hexoid is documented as not "cryptographically secure." (Also, there is a scenario in which only the last two characters of a hexoid string need to be guessed, but this is not often relevant.) NOTE: this does not imply that, in a typical use case, attackers will be able to exploit any hexoid behavior to upload and execute their own content.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-46653'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-46653</a>

NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2024-46954.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-46646'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-46646</a>

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary PHP files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where PHP files can be uploaded and included.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-2101'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-2101</a>
