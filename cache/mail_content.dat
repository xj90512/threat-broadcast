<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-5944</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-07-03 05:15:25<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The Element Pack Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘data-caption’ attribute in all versions up to, and including, 8.0.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-5944'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-5944</a>

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-52559</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-07-02 20:15:31<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Zulip is an open-source team chat application. From versions 2.0.0-rc1 to before 10.4 in Zulip Server, the /digest/ URL of a server shows a preview of what the email weekly digest would contain. This URL, though not the digest itself, contains a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in both topic names and channel names. This issue has been fixed in Zulip Server 10.4. A workaround for this issue involves denying access to /digest/.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-52559'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-52559</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-43025</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-07-02 20:15:30<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] HP Universal Print Driver is potentially vulnerable to denial of service due to buffer overflow in versions of UPD 7.4 or older (e.g., v7.3.x, v7.2.x, v7.1.x, etc.).<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-43025'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-43025</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-34092</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-07-02 20:15:30<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A cookie encryption bypass vulnerability exists in Google Chrome’s AppBound mechanism due to weak path validation logic within the elevation service. When Chrome encrypts a cookie key, it records its own executable path as validation metadata. Later, when decrypting, the elevation service compares the requesting process’s path to this stored path. However, due to path canonicalization inconsistencies, an attacker can impersonate Chrome (e.g., by naming their binary chrome.exe and placing it in a similar path) and successfully retrieve the encrypted cookie key. This allows malicious processes to retrieve cookies intended to be restricted to the Chrome process only. Confirmed in Google Chrome with AppBound Encryption enabled. Other Chromium-based browsers may be affected if they implement similar COM-based encryption mechanisms.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-34092'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-34092</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-34091</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-07-02 20:15:30<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A padding oracle vulnerability exists in Google Chrome’s AppBound cookie encryption mechanism due to observable decryption failure behavior in Windows Event Logs when handling malformed ciphertext in SYSTEM-DPAPI-encrypted blobs. A local attacker can repeatedly send malformed ciphertexts to the Chrome elevation service and distinguish between padding and MAC errors, enabling a padding oracle attack. This allows partial decryption of the SYSTEM-DPAPI layer and eventual recovery of the user-DPAPI encrypted cookie key, which is trivially decrypted by the attacker’s own context. This issue undermines the core purpose of AppBound Encryption by enabling low-privileged cookie theft through cryptographic misuse and verbose error feedback. Confirmed in Google Chrome with AppBound Encryption enabled. Other Chromium-based browsers may be affected if they implement similar COM-based encryption mechanisms. This behavior arises from a combination of Chrome’s AppBound implementation and the way Microsoft Windows DPAPI reports decryption failures via Event Logs. As such, the vulnerability relies on cryptographic behavior and error visibility in all supported versions of Windows.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-34091'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-34091</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-34090</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-07-02 20:15:30<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A security bypass vulnerability exists in Google Chrome AppBound cookie encryption mechanism due to insufficient validation of COM server paths during inter-process communication. A local low-privileged attacker can hijack the COM class identifier (CLSID) registration used by Chrome's elevation service and point it to a non-existent or malicious binary. When this hijack occurs, Chrome silently falls back to the legacy cookie encryption mechanism (protected only by user-DPAPI), thereby enabling cookie decryption by any user-context malware without SYSTEM-level access. This flaw bypasses the protections intended by the AppBound encryption design and allows cookie theft from Chromium-based browsers. Confirmed in Google Chrome with AppBound Encryption enabled. Other Chromium-based browsers may be affected if they implement similar COM-based encryption mechanisms.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-34090'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-34090</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-34079</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-07-02 20:15:29<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] An authenticated remote code execution vulnerability exists in NSClient++ version 0.5.2.35 when the web interface and ExternalScripts module are enabled. A remote attacker with the administrator password can authenticate to the web interface (default port 8443), inject arbitrary commands as external scripts via the /settings/query.json API, save the configuration, and trigger the script via the /query/{name} endpoint. The injected commands are executed with SYSTEM privileges, enabling full remote compromise. This capability is an intended feature, but the lack of safeguards or privilege separation makes it risky when exposed to untrusted actors.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-34079'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-34079</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-34078</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-07-02 20:15:29<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A local privilege escalation vulnerability exists in NSClient++ 0.5.2.35 when both the web interface and ExternalScripts features are enabled. The configuration file (nsclient.ini) stores the administrative password in plaintext and is readable by local users. By extracting this password, an attacker can authenticate to the NSClient++ web interface (typically accessible on port 8443) and abuse the ExternalScripts plugin to inject and execute arbitrary commands as SYSTEM by registering a custom script, saving the configuration, and triggering it via the API. This behavior is documented but insecure, as the plaintext credential exposure undermines access isolation between local users and administrative functions.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-34078'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-34078</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-34076</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-07-02 20:15:29<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] An authenticated local file inclusion vulnerability exists in Microweber CMS versions <= 1.2.11 through misuse of the backup management API. Authenticated users can abuse the /api/BackupV2/upload and /api/BackupV2/download endpoints to read arbitrary files from the underlying filesystem. By specifying an absolute file path in the src parameter of the upload request, the server may relocate or delete the target file depending on the web service user’s privileges. The corresponding download endpoint can then be used to retrieve the file contents, effectively enabling local file disclosure. This behavior stems from insufficient validation of user-supplied paths and inadequate restrictions on file access and backup logic.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-34076'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-34076</a>
