<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-5967</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-06-18 12:15:12<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A vulnerability was found in Keycloak. The LDAP testing endpoint allows changing the Connection URL independently without re-entering the currently configured LDAP bind credentials. This flaw allows an attacker with admin access (permission manage-realm) to change the LDAP host URL ("Connection URL") to a machine they control. The Keycloak server will connect to the attacker's host and try to authenticate with the configured credentials, thus leaking them to the attacker. As a consequence, an attacker who has compromised the admin console or compromised a user with sufficient privileges can leak domain credentials and attack the domain.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-5967'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-5967</a>
