<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-40573</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-08-24 02:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. XWiki supports scheduled jobs that contain Groovy scripts. Currently, the job checks the content author of the job for programming right. However, modifying or adding a job script to a document doesn't modify the content author. Together with a CSRF vulnerability in the job scheduler, this can be exploited for remote code execution by an attacker with edit right on the wiki. If the attack is successful, an error log entry with "Job content executed" will be produced. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 14.10.9 and 15.4RC1.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-40573'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-40573</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-40572</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-08-24 02:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. The create action is vulnerable to a CSRF attack, allowing script and thus remote code execution when targeting a user with script/programming right, thus compromising the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation. When a user with script right views this image and a log message `ERROR foo - Script executed!` appears in the log, the XWiki installation is vulnerable. This has been patched in XWiki 14.10.9 and 15.4RC1 by requiring a CSRF token for the actual page creation.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-40572'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-40572</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-32559</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-08-24 02:15:00<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the experimental policy mechanism in all active release lines: 16.x, 18.x and, 20.x. The use of the deprecated API `process.binding()` can bypass the policy mechanism by requiring internal modules and eventually take advantage of `process.binding('spawn_sync')` run arbitrary code, outside of the limits defined in a `policy.json` file. Please note that at the time this CVE was issued, the policy is an experimental feature of Node.js.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-32559'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-32559</a>
