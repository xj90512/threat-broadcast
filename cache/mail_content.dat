<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-24862</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-04-14 13:15:48<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] In function pci1xxxx_spi_probe, there is a potential null pointer that may be caused by a failed memory allocation by the function devm_kzalloc. Hence, a null pointer check needs to be added to prevent null pointer dereferencing later in the code. To fix this issue, spi_bus->spi_int[iter] should be checked. The memory allocated by devm_kzalloc will be automatically released, so just directly return -ENOMEM without worrying about memory leaks.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-24862'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-24862</a>
