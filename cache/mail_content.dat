<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-6981</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-07-15 21:15:34<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] An incorrect authorization vulnerability allowed unauthorized read access to the contents of internal repositories for contractor accounts when the Contractors API feature was enabled. The Contractors API is a rarely-enabled feature in private preview. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.18 and was fixed in versions 3.14.15, 3.15.10, 3.16.6 and 3.17.3<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-6981'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-6981</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-53906</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-07-15 21:15:34<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Vim is an open source, command line text editor. Prior to version 9.1.1551, a path traversal issue in Vim’s zip.vim plugin can allow overwriting of arbitrary files when opening specially crafted zip archives. Impact is low because this exploit requires direct user interaction. However, successfully exploitation can lead to overwriting sensitive files or placing executable code in privileged locations, depending on the permissions of the process editing the archive. The victim must edit such a file using Vim which will reveal the filename and the file content, a careful user may suspect some strange things going on. Successful exploitation could results in the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system. Version 9.1.1551 contains a patch for the vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-53906'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-53906</a>

In versions 20250228v3 and prior, there is an unsafe deserialization vulnerability in process_ckpt.py. The SoVITS_dropdown variable takes user input and passes it to the load_sovits_new function in process_ckpt.py. In load_sovits_new, the user input, here sovits_path is used to load a model with torch.load, leading to unsafe deserialization.

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-49839</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-07-15 21:15:32<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] GPT-SoVITS-WebUI is a voice conversion and text-to-speech webUI. In versions 20250228v3 and prior, there is an unsafe deserialization vulnerability in bsroformer.py. The model_choose variable takes user input (e.g. a path to a model) and passes it to the uvr function. In uvr, a new instance of Roformer_Loader class is created with the model_path attribute containing the aformentioned user input (here called locally model_name). Note that in this step the .ckpt extension is added to the path. In the Roformer_Loader class, the user input, here called model_path, is used to load the model on that path with torch.load, which can lead to unsafe deserialization.
