<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-31452</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-04-16 22:15:35<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] OpenFGA is a high-performance and flexible authorization/permission engine. Some end users of OpenFGA v1.5.0 or later are vulnerable to authorization bypass when calling Check or ListObjects APIs. You are very likely affected if your model involves exclusion (e.g. `a but not b`) or intersection (e.g. `a and b`). This vulnerability is fixed in v1.5.3.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-31452'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-31452</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-27086</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-04-16 22:15:34<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The MSAL library enabled acquisition of security tokens to call protected APIs. MSAL.NET applications targeting Xamarin Android and .NET Android (e.g., MAUI) using the library from versions 4.48.0 to 4.60.0 are impacted by a low severity vulnerability. A malicious application running on a customer Android device can cause local denial of service against applications that were built using MSAL.NET for authentication on the same device (i.e., prevent the user of the legitimate application from logging in) due to incorrect activity export configuration. MSAL.NET version 4.60.1 includes the fix. As a workaround, a developer may explicitly mark the MSAL.NET activity non-exported.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-27086'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-27086</a>
