<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-21655</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-01-20 14:15:27<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: io_uring/eventfd: ensure io_eventfd_signal() defers another RCU period io_eventfd_do_signal() is invoked from an RCU callback, but when dropping the reference to the io_ev_fd, it calls io_eventfd_free() directly if the refcount drops to zero. This isn't correct, as any potential freeing of the io_ev_fd should be deferred another RCU grace period. Just call io_eventfd_put() rather than open-code the dec-and-test and free, which will correctly defer it another RCU grace period.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-21655'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-21655</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-13176</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-01-20 14:15:26<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Issue summary: A timing side-channel which could potentially allow recovering the private key exists in the ECDSA signature computation. Impact summary: A timing side-channel in ECDSA signature computations could allow recovering the private key by an attacker. However, measuring the timing would require either local access to the signing application or a very fast network connection with low latency. There is a timing signal of around 300 nanoseconds when the top word of the inverted ECDSA nonce value is zero. This can happen with significant probability only for some of the supported elliptic curves. In particular the NIST P-521 curve is affected. To be able to measure this leak, the attacker process must either be located in the same physical computer or must have a very fast network connection with low latency. For that reason the severity of this vulnerability is Low.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-13176'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-13176</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-52923</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-01-20 10:48:13<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: netfilter: nf_tables: adapt set backend to use GC transaction API Use the GC transaction API to replace the old and buggy gc API and the busy mark approach. No set elements are removed from async garbage collection anymore, instead the _DEAD bit is set on so the set element is not visible from lookup path anymore. Async GC enqueues transaction work that might be aborted and retried later. rbtree and pipapo set backends does not set on the _DEAD bit from the sync GC path since this runs in control plane path where mutex is held. In this case, set elements are deactivated, removed and then released via RCU callback, sync GC never fails.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-52923'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-52923</a>
