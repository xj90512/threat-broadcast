This ACE (Arbitrary Code Execution) vulnerability, with a CVSS Score of 5.9, allows a locally authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code which has high impact to confidentiality, high impact to integrity, high impact to availability, and requires user interaction. Atlassian recommends that Sourcetree for Mac users upgrade to the latest version. If you are unable to do so, upgrade your instance to one of the specified supported fixed versions. See the release notes https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/download-archives . You can download the latest version of Sourcetree for Mac from the download center https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/download-archives . This vulnerability was found through the Atlassian Bug Bounty Program by Karol Mazurek (AFINE).<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-22165'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-22165</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-54379</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-07-24 22:24:23<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] LF Edge eKuiper is a lightweight IoT data analytics and stream processing engine running on resource-constraint edge devices. In versions before 2.2.1, there is a critical SQL Injection vulnerability in the getLast API functionality of the eKuiper project. This flaw allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL statements on the underlying SQLite database by manipulating the table name input in an API request. Exploitation can lead to data theft, corruption, or deletion, and full database compromise. This is fixed in version 2.2.1.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-54379'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-54379</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-53940</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-07-24 22:23:58<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Quiet is an alternative to team chat apps like Slack, Discord, and Element that does not require trusting a central server or running one's own. In versions 6.1.0-alpha.4 and below, Quiet's API for backend/frontend communication was using an insecure, not constant-time comparison function for token verification. This allowed for a potential timing attack where an attacker would try different token values and observe tiny differences in the response time (wrong characters fail faster) to guess the whole token one character at a time. This is fixed in version 6.0.1.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-53940'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-53940</a>
