An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to trick a client into making an unintentional request to the web server, which will be treated as an authentic request. This vulnerability may lead an attacker to perform operations on behalf of the victimized user.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-5961'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-5961</a>

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-6972</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-12-23 02:15:45<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The Backup Migration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Path Traversal in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.9 via the 'content-backups' and 'content-name', 'content-manifest', or 'content-bmitmp' and 'content-identy' HTTP headers. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files, including the wp-config.php file, which can make site takeover and remote code execution possible.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-6972'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-6972</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-6971</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-12-23 02:15:45<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The Backup Migration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion in versions 1.0.8 to 1.3.9 via the 'content-dir' HTTP header. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include remote files on the server, resulting in code execution. NOTE: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that the target server's php.ini is configured with 'allow_url_include' set to 'on'. This feature is deprecated as of PHP 7.4 and is disabled by default, but can still be explicitly enabled in later versions of PHP.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-6971'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-6971</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-51386</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-12-22 22:15:07<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Sandbox Accounts for Events provides multiple, temporary AWS accounts to a number of authenticated users simultaneously via a browser-based GUI. Authenticated users could potentially read data from the events table by sending request payloads to the events API, collecting information on planned events, timeframes, budgets and owner email addresses. This data access may allow users to get insights into upcoming events and join events which they have not been invited to. This issue has been patched in version 1.10.0.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-51386'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-51386</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-51651</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2023-12-22 21:15:09<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] AWS SDK for PHP is the Amazon Web Services software development kit for PHP. Within the scope of requests to S3 object keys and/or prefixes containing a Unix double-dot, a URI path traversal is possible. The issue exists in the `buildEndpoint` method in the RestSerializer component of the AWS SDK for PHP v3 prior to 3.288.1. The `buildEndpoint` method relies on the Guzzle Psr7 UriResolver utility, which strips dot segments from the request path in accordance with RFC 3986. Under certain conditions, this could lead to an arbitrary object being accessed. This issue has been patched in version 3.288.1.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-51651'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-51651</a>
