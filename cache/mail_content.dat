<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-3410</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-09-14 09:15:01<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The Bricks theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘customTag' attribute in versions up to, and including, 1.10.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with access to the Bricks Builder (admin-only by default), to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This becomes more of an issue when Bricks Builder access is granted to lower-privileged users.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-3410'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-3410</a>

This occurs when using tasks such as include_vars to load vaulted variables without setting the no_log: true parameter, resulting in sensitive data being printed in the playbook output or logs. This can lead to the unintentional disclosure of secrets like passwords or API keys, compromising security and potentially allowing unauthorized access or actions.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-8775'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-8775</a>

This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode in the 'woocs_get_custom_price_html' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-8271'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-8271</a>
