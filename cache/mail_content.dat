<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-6985</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-10-11 15:38:08<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A path traversal vulnerability exists in the api open_personality_folder endpoint of parisneo/lollms-webui. This vulnerability allows an attacker to read any folder in the personality_folder on the victim's computer, even though sanitize_path is set. The issue arises due to improper sanitization of the personality_folder parameter, which can be exploited to traverse directories and access arbitrary files.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-6985'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-6985</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-47509</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-10-11 15:36:33<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] An Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling vulnerability in the PFE management daemon (evo-pfemand) of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an authenticated, network-based attacker to cause an FPC crash leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).When specific SNMP GET operations or specific low-priviledged CLI commands are executed, a GUID resource leak will occur, eventually leading to exhaustion and resulting in FPCs to hang. Affected FPCs need to be manually restarted to recover. GUID exhaustion will trigger a syslog message like one of the following: evo-pfemand[<pid>]: get_next_guid: Ran out of Guid Space ... evo-aftmand-zx[<pid>]: get_next_guid: Ran out of Guid Space ... The leak can be monitored by running the following command and taking note of the values in the rightmost column labeled Guids: user@host> show platform application-info allocations app evo-pfemand/evo-pfemand In case one or more of these values are constantly increasing the leak is happening. This issue affects Junos OS Evolved: * All versions before 21.4R2-EVO, * 22.1 versions before 22.1R2-EVO. Please note that this issue is similar to, but different from CVE-2024-47505 and CVE-2024-47508.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-47509'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-47509</a>
