<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-12224</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-05-30 02:15:19<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in punycode by the idna crate from Servo rust-url allows an attacker to create a punycode hostname that one part of a system might treat as distinct while another part of that system would treat as equivalent to another hostname.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-12224'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-12224</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2020-36846</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-05-30 01:15:20<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A buffer overflow, as described in CVE-2020-8927, exists in the embedded Brotli library. Versions of IO::Compress::Brotli prior to 0.007 included a version of the brotli library prior to version 1.0.8, where an attacker controlling the input length of a "one-shot" decompression request to a script can trigger a crash, which happens when copying over chunks of data larger than 2 GiB. It is recommended to update your IO::Compress::Brotli module to 0.007 or later. If one cannot update, we recommend to use the "streaming" API as opposed to the "one-shot" API, and impose chunk size limits.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2020-36846'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2020-36846</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-46352</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-05-30 00:15:23<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The CS5000 Fire Panel is vulnerable due to a hard-coded password that runs on a VNC server and is visible as a string in the binary responsible for running VNC. This password cannot be altered, allowing anyone with knowledge of it to gain remote access to the panel. Such access could enable an attacker to operate the panel remotely, potentially putting the fire panel into a non-functional state and causing serious safety issues.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-46352'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-46352</a>

Even though it is possible to change this by SSHing into the device, it has remained unchanged on every installed system observed. This account is not root but holds high-level permissions that could severely impact the device's operation if exploited.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-41438'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-41438</a>
