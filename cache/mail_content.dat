This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Editor-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-7351'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-7351</a>
