<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-2578</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-03-28 08:15:15<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The Booking for Appointments and Events Calendar &#8211; Amelia plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.19 via the 'wpAmeliaApiCall' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-2578'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-2578</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-2074</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-03-28 08:15:15<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The Advanced Google reCAPTCHA plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to generic SQL Injection via the ‘sSearch’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.29 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries, particularly when the plugin’s settings page hasn’t been visited and its welcome message has not been dismissed. This issue can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-2074'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-2074</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-2485</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-03-28 07:15:39<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload for Contact Form 7 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.8.7 via deserialization of untrusted input from the 'dnd_upload_cf7_upload' function. This makes it possible for attackers to inject a PHP Object through a PHAR file. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present. This vulnerability may be exploited by unauthenticated attackers when a form is present on the site with the file upload action. The Flamingo plugin must be installed and activated in order to exploit the vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-2485'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-2485</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-2328</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-03-28 07:15:39<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload for Contact Form 7 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the 'dnd_remove_uploaded_files' function in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.8.7. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add arbitrary file paths (such as ../../../../wp-config.php) to uploaded files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when an Administrator deletes the message. Exploiting this vulnerability requires the Flamingo plugin to be installed and activated.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-2328'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-2328</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-31335</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-03-28 06:15:34<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The OpenSAML C++ library before 3.3.1 allows forging of signed SAML messages via parameter manipulation (when using SAML bindings that rely on non-XML signatures).<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-31335'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-31335</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-2804</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-03-28 06:15:34<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The tagDiv Composer plugin for WordPress, used by the Newspaper theme, is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the 'account_id' and 'account_username' parameters in all versions up to, and including, 5.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-2804'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-2804</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-2027</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-03-28 06:15:33<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A double free vulnerability has been identified in the ASUS System Analysis service. This vulnerability can be triggered by sending specially crafted local RPC requests, leading to the service crash and potentially memory manipulation in some rare circumstances. Refer to the 'Security Update for MyASUS' section on the ASUS Security Advisory for more information.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-2027'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-2027</a>

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-2294</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-03-28 05:15:41<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The Kubio AI Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.1 via thekubio_hybrid_theme_load_template function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-2294'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-2294</a>
