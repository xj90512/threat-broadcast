<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-30204</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-03-21 22:15:26<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] golang-jwt is a Go implementation of JSON Web Tokens. Prior to 5.2.2 and 4.5.2, the function parse.ParseUnverified splits (via a call to strings.Split) its argument (which is untrusted data) on periods. As a result, in the face of a malicious request whose Authorization header consists of Bearer followed by many period characters, a call to that function incurs allocations to the tune of O(n) bytes (where n stands for the length of the function's argument), with a constant factor of about 16. This issue is fixed in 5.2.2 and 4.5.2.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-30204'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-30204</a>
