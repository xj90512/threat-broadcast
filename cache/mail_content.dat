<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-2520</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-07-10 19:54:35<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The Honeywell Experion PKS contains an Uninitialized Variable in the common Epic Platform Analyzer (EPA) communications. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to a Communication Channel Manipulation, which results in a dereferencing of an uninitialized pointer leading to a denial of service. Honeywell recommends updating to the most recent version of Honeywell Experion PKS: 520.2 TCU9 HF1and 530.1 TCU3 HF1. The affected Experion PKS products are C300 PCNT02, EHB, EHPM, ELMM, Classic ENIM, ETN, FIM4, FIM8, PGM, and RFIM. The Experion PKS versions affected are from 520.1 through 520.2 TCU9 and from 530 through 530 TCU3.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-2520'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-2520</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-53629</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-07-10 19:46:01<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] cpp-httplib is a C++11 single-file header-only cross platform HTTP/HTTPS library. Prior to 0.23.0, incoming requests using Transfer-Encoding: chunked in the header can allocate memory arbitrarily in the server, potentially leading to its exhaustion. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.23.0.

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-53634</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-07-10 19:39:57<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Chall-Manager is a platform-agnostic system able to start Challenges on Demand of a player. The HTTP Gateway processes headers, but with no timeout set. With a slow loris attack, an attacker could cause Denial of Service (DoS). Exploitation does not require authentication nor authorization, so anyone can exploit it. It should nonetheless not be exploitable as it is highly recommended to bury Chall-Manager deep within the infrastructure due to its large capabilities, so no users could reach the system. Patch has been implemented by commit 1385bd8 and shipped in v0.1.4.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-53634'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-53634</a>

The plugin fails to properly validate or restrict file types or locations during upload operations, allowing an attacker to upload a malicious .php file and subsequently execute arbitrary PHP code on the server under the context of the web server process. While the root vulnerability lies within the jQuery File Upload component, BuilderEngine’s improper integration and lack of access controls expose this functionality to unauthenticated users, resulting in full remote code execution.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-34100'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-34100</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-34102</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-07-10 19:16:01<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A remote code execution vulnerability exists in CryptoLog (PHP version, discontinued since 2009) due to a chained exploitation of SQL injection and command injection vulnerabilities. An unauthenticated attacker can gain shell access as the web server user by first exploiting a SQL injection flaw in login.php to bypass authentication, followed by command injection in logshares_ajax.php to execute arbitrary operating system commands. The login bypass is achieved by submitting crafted SQL via the user POST parameter. Once authenticated, the attacker can abuse the lsid POST parameter in the logshares_ajax.php endpoint to inject and execute a command using $(...) syntax, resulting in code execution under the web context. This exploitation path does not exist in the ASP.NET version of CryptoLog released since 2009.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-34102'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-34102</a>
