This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-5212'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-5212</a>

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-7435'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-7435</a>

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-8006</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-08-31 00:15:05<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Remote packet capture support is disabled by default in libpcap. When a user builds libpcap with remote packet capture support enabled, one of the functions that become available is pcap_findalldevs_ex(). One of the function arguments can be a filesystem path, which normally means a directory with input data files. When the specified path cannot be used as a directory, the function receives NULL from opendir(), but does not check the return value and passes the NULL value to readdir(), which causes a NULL pointer derefence.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-8006'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-8006</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-45304</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-08-31 00:15:05<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Cairo-Contracts are OpenZeppelin Contracts written in Cairo for Starknet, a decentralized ZK Rollup. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized ownership transfer, contrary to the original owner's intention of leaving the contract without an owner. It introduces a security risk where an unintended party (pending owner) can gain control of the contract after the original owner has renounced ownership. This could also be used by a malicious owner to simulate leaving a contract without an owner, to later regain ownership by previously having proposed himself as a pending owner. This issue has been addressed in release version 0.16.0. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-45304'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-45304</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2023-7256</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-08-31 00:15:05<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] In affected libpcap versions during the setup of a remote packet capture the internal function sock_initaddress() calls getaddrinfo() and possibly freeaddrinfo(), but does not clearly indicate to the caller function whether freeaddrinfo() still remains to be called after the function returns. This makes it possible in some scenarios that both the function and its caller call freeaddrinfo() for the same allocated memory block. A similar problem was reported in Apple libpcap, to which Apple assigned CVE-2023-40400.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-7256'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2023-7256</a>
