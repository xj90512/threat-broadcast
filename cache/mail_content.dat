This misconfiguration can lead to information disclosure, leaking sensitive details such as diagnostic log traces, system logs, headunit passwords, and personally identifiable information (PII). The exposure of such information may have serious implications for user privacy and system integrity.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-39339'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-39339</a>

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-46989</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-09-18 18:15:07<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] spicedb is an Open Source, Google Zanzibar-inspired permissions database to enable fine-grained authorization for customer applications. Multiple caveats over the same indirect subject type on the same relation can result in no permission being returned when permission is expected. If the resource has multiple groups, and each group is caveated, it is possible for the returned permission to be "no permission" when permission is expected. Permission is returned as NO_PERMISSION when PERMISSION is expected on the CheckPermission API. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.35.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should not use caveats or avoid the use of caveats on an indirect subject type with multiple entries.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-46989'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-46989</a>

A path traversal vulnerability accessible via MediaController's download_private_file method allows authenticated users to download any file on the web server Camaleon CMS is running on (depending on the file permissions). This issue may lead to Information Disclosure. This issue has been addressed in release version 2.8.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-46987'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-46987</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-46986</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-09-18 18:15:07<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Camaleon CMS is a dynamic and advanced content management system based on Ruby on Rails. An arbitrary file write vulnerability accessible via the upload method of the MediaController allows authenticated users to write arbitrary files to any location on the web server Camaleon CMS is running on (depending on the permissions of the underlying filesystem). E.g. This can lead to a delayed remote code execution in case an attacker is able to write a Ruby file into the config/initializers/ subfolder of the Ruby on Rails application. This issue has been addressed in release version 2.8.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-46986'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-46986</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-46979</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-09-18 18:15:07<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. It's possible to get access to notification filters of any user by using a URL such as `<hostname>xwiki/bin/get/XWiki/Notifications/Code/NotificationFilterPreferenceLivetableResults?outputSyntax=plain&type=custom&user=<username>`. This vulnerability impacts all versions of XWiki since 13.2-rc-1. The filters do not provide much information (they mainly contain references which are public data in XWiki), though some info could be used in combination with other vulnerabilities. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 14.10.21, 15.5.5, 15.10.1, 16.0RC1. The patch consists in checking the rights of the user when sending the data. Users are advised to upgrade. It's possible to workaround the vulnerability by applying manually the patch: it's possible for an administrator to edit directly the document `XWiki.Notifications.Code.NotificationFilterPreferenceLivetableResults` to apply the same changes as in the patch.
