<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-47271</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-05-12 11:15:51<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The OZI action is a GitHub Action that publishes releases to PyPI and mirror releases, signature bundles, and provenance in a tagged release. In versions 1.13.2 through 1.13.5, potentially untrusted data flows into PR creation logic. A malicious actor could construct a branch name that injects arbitrary code. This is patched in 1.13.6. As a workaround, one may downgrade to a version prior to 1.13.2.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-47271'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-47271</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-47270</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-05-12 11:15:51<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] nimiq/core-rs-albatross is a Rust implementation of the Nimiq Proof-of-Stake protocol based on the Albatross consensus algorithm. The `nimiq-network-libp2p` subcrate of nimiq/core-rs-albatross is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to uncontrolled memory allocation. Specifically, the implementation of the `Discovery` network message handling allocates a buffer based on a length value provided by the peer, without enforcing an upper bound. Since this length is a `u32`, a peer can trigger allocations of up to 4 GB, potentially leading to memory exhaustion and node crashes. As Discovery messages are regularly exchanged for peer discovery, this vulnerability can be exploited repeatedly. The patch for this vulnerability is formally released as part of v1.1.0. The patch implements a limit to the discovery message size of 1 MB and also resizes the message buffer size incrementally as the data is read. No known workarounds are available.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-47270'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-47270</a>

Prior to version 9.0.8, HTML Injection in Knowledge Base (KB) articles leads to complete page defacement imitating the login page. Authenticated users with the read knowledge article privilege can browse to the KB article and if they submit their credentials, they get captured in plain text. The vulnerability is allowed by overly permissive HTML editing being allowed on the KB articles. Any authenticated user with the privilege to read KB articles is impacted. In an enterprise with multiple applications, the malicious KB article could be edited to match the login pages of other applications, which would make it useful for credential harvesting against other applications as well. Version 9.0.8 contains a patch for the issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-32390'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-32390</a>
