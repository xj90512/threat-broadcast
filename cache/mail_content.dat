<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-38235</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-07-06 10:15:24<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: HID: appletb-kbd: fix "appletb_backlight" backlight device reference counting During appletb_kbd_probe, probe attempts to get the backlight device by name. When this happens backlight_device_get_by_name looks for a device in the backlight class which has name "appletb_backlight" and upon finding a match it increments the reference count for the device and returns it to the caller. However this reference is never released leading to a reference leak. Fix this by decrementing the backlight device reference count on removal via put_device and on probe failure.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-38235'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-38235</a>
