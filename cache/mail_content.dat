<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-5481</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-06-07 10:15:11<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The Photo Gallery by 10Web – Mobile-Friendly Image Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Path Traversal in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.23 via the esc_dir function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to cut and paste (copy) the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information, and to cut (delete) arbitrary directories, including the root WordPress directory. By default this can be exploited by administrators only. In the premium version of the plugin, administrators can give gallery edit permissions to lower level users, which might make this exploitable by users as low as contributors.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-5481'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-5481</a>
