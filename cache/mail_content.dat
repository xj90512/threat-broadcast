<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-54867</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-08-14 16:15:39<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Youki is a container runtime written in Rust. Prior to version 0.5.5, if /proc and /sys in the rootfs are symbolic links, they can potentially be exploited to gain access to the host root filesystem. This issue has been patched in version 0.5.5.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-54867'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-54867</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-54409</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-08-14 16:15:39<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] AIDE is an advanced intrusion detection environment. From versions 0.13 to 0.19.1, there is a null pointer dereference vulnerability in AIDE. An attacker can crash the program during report printing or database listing after setting extended file attributes with an empty attribute value or with a key containing a comma. A local user might exploit this to cause a local denial of service. This issue has been patched in version 0.19.2. A workaround involves removing xattrs group from rules matching files on affected file systems.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-54409'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-54409</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-54389</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-08-14 16:15:37<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] AIDE is an advanced intrusion detection environment. Prior to version 0.19.2, there is an improper output neutralization vulnerability in AIDE. An attacker can craft a malicious filename by including terminal escape sequences to hide the addition or removal of the file from the report and/or tamper with the log output. A local user might exploit this to bypass the AIDE detection of malicious files. Additionally the output of extended attribute key names and symbolic links targets are also not properly neutralized. This issue has been patched in version 0.19.2. A workaround involves configuring AIDE to write the report output to a regular file, redirecting stdout to a regular file, or redirecting the log output written to stderr to a regular file.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-54389'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-54389</a>
