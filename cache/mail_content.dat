<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-56361</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-12-26 22:15:19<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] LGSL (Live Game Server List) provides online status for games. Before 7.0.0, a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in lgsl. The function lgsl_query_40 in lgsl_protocol.php has implemented an HTTP crawler. This function makes a request to the registered game server, and upon crawling the malicious /info endpoint with our payload, will render our javascript on the info page. This information is being displayed via lgsl_details.php. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.0.0.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-56361'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-56361</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-55950</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-12-26 22:15:17<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Tabby (formerly Terminus) is a highly configurable terminal emulator. Prior to 1.0.216, Tabby terminal emulator contains overly permissive entitlements that are unnecessary for its core functionality and plugin system, creating potential security vulnerabilities. The application currently holds powerful permissions including camera, microphone access, and the ability to access personal folders (Downloads, Documents, etc.) through Apple Events, while also maintaining dangerous entitlements that enable code injection. The concerning entitlements are com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables and com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation. Since Tabby's plugins and themes are NodeJS-based without native libraries or frameworks, and no environment variables are used in the codebase, it is recommended to review and remove at least one of the entitlements (com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation or com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables) to prevent DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES injection while maintaining full application functionality. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.0.216.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-55950'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-55950</a>

Before 6.3.0, general users can access information that can only be accessed by users with access privileges to admin and support information (SETTINGS_SUPPORT). This is due to inadequate access control for support information (http://<opencti_domain>/storage/get/support/UUID/UUID.zip), and that the UUID is available to general users using an attached query (logs query). This vulnerability is fixed in 6.3.0.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-45805'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-45805</a>
