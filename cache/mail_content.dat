<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-27304</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-03-06 19:15:08<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] pgx is a PostgreSQL driver and toolkit for Go. SQL injection can occur if an attacker can cause a single query or bind message to exceed 4 GB in size. An integer overflow in the calculated message size can cause the one large message to be sent as multiple messages under the attacker's control. The problem is resolved in v4.18.2 and v5.5.4. As a workaround, reject user input large enough to cause a single query or bind message to exceed 4 GB in size.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-27304'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-27304</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-27303</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-03-06 19:15:08<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] electron-builder is a solution to package and build a ready for distribution Electron, Proton Native app for macOS, Windows and Linux. A vulnerability that only affects eletron-builder prior to 24.13.2 in Windows, the NSIS installer makes a system call to open cmd.exe via NSExec in the `.nsh` installer script. NSExec by default searches the current directory of where the installer is located before searching `PATH`. This means that if an attacker can place a malicious executable file named cmd.exe in the same folder as the installer, the installer will run the malicious file. Version 24.13.2 fixes this issue. No known workaround exists. The code executes at the installer-level before the app is present on the system, so there's no way to check if it exists in a current installer.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-27303'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-27303</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-27302</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-03-06 19:15:08<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] go-zero is a web and rpc framework. Go-zero allows user to specify a CORS Filter with a configurable allows param - which is an array of domains allowed in CORS policy. However, the `isOriginAllowed` uses `strings.HasSuffix` to check the origin, which leads to bypass via a malicious domain. This vulnerability is capable of breaking CORS policy and thus allowing any page to make requests and/or retrieve data on behalf of other users. Version 1.4.4 fixes this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-27302'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-27302</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-27289</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-03-06 19:15:08<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] pgx is a PostgreSQL driver and toolkit for Go. Prior to version 4.18.2, SQL injection can occur when all of the following conditions are met: the non-default simple protocol is used; a placeholder for a numeric value must be immediately preceded by a minus; there must be a second placeholder for a string value after the first placeholder; both must be on the same line; and both parameter values must be user-controlled. The problem is resolved in v4.18.2. As a workaround, do not use the simple protocol or do not place a minus directly before a placeholder.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-27289'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-27289</a>

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-27287</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-03-06 19:15:07<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] ESPHome is a system to control your ESP8266/ESP32 for Home Automation systems. Starting in version 2023.12.9 and prior to version 2024.2.2, editing the configuration file API in dashboard component of ESPHome version 2023.12.9 (command line installation and Home Assistant add-on) serves unsanitized data with `Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8`, allowing a remote authenticated user to inject arbitrary web script and exfiltrate session cookies via Cross-Site scripting. It is possible for a malicious authenticated user to inject arbitrary Javascript in configuration files using a POST request to the /edit endpoint, the configuration parameter allows to specify the file to write. To trigger the XSS vulnerability, the victim must visit the page` /edit?configuration=[xss file]`. Abusing this vulnerability a malicious actor could perform operations on the dashboard on the behalf of a logged user, access sensitive information, create, edit and delete configuration files and flash firmware on managed boards. In addition to this, cookies are not correctly secured, allowing the exfiltration of session cookie values. Version 2024.2.2 contains a patch for this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-27287'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-27287</a>

Starting in version 3.5.27 and prior to version 6.8, Squid may be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack against HTTP Chunked decoder due to an uncontrolled recursion bug. This problem allows a remote attacker to cause Denial of Service when sending a crafted, chunked, encoded HTTP Message. This bug is fixed in Squid version 6.8. In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable releases can be found in Squid's patch archives. There is no workaround for this issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-25111'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-25111</a>
