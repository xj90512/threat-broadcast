<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-5165</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-05-23 10:15:10<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] In Eclipse Ditto versions 3.0.0 to 3.5.5, the user input of several input fields of the Eclipse Ditto Explorer User Interface https://eclipse.dev/ditto/user-interface.html was not properly neutralized and thus vulnerable to both Reflected and Stored XSS (Cross Site Scripting). Several inputs were not persisted at the backend of Eclipse Ditto, but only in local browser storage to save settings of "environments" of the UI and e.g. the last performed "search queries", resulting in a "Reflected XSS" vulnerability. However, several other inputs were persisted at the backend of Eclipse Ditto, leading to a "Stored XSS" vulnerability. Those mean that authenticated and authorized users at Eclipse Ditto can persist Things in Ditto which can - when being displayed by other users also being authorized to see those Things in the Eclipse Ditto UI - cause scripts to be executed in the browser of other users.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-5165'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-5165</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-4779</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-05-23 10:15:09<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The Unlimited Elements For Elementor (Free Widgets, Addons, Templates) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the ‘data[post_ids][0]’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.107 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-4779'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-4779</a>

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-2861'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-2861</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-5264</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-05-23 09:15:10<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Network Transfer with AES KHT in Thales Luna EFT 2.1 and above allows a user with administrative console access to access backups taken via offline analysis<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-5264'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-5264</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-35223</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-05-23 09:15:09<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Dapr is a portable, event-driven, runtime for building distributed applications across cloud and edge. Dapr sends the app token of the invoker app instead of the app token of the invoked app. This causes of a leak of the application token of the invoker app to the invoked app when using Dapr as a gRPC proxy for remote service invocation. This vulnerability impacts Dapr users who use Dapr as a gRPC proxy for remote service invocation as well as the Dapr App API token functionality. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain access to the app token of the invoker app, potentially compromising security and authentication mechanisms. This vulnerability was patched in version 1.13.3.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-35223'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-35223</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-35186</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-05-23 09:15:09<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] gitoxide is a pure Rust implementation of Git. During checkout, `gix-worktree-state` does not verify that paths point to locations in the working tree. A specially crafted repository can, when cloned, place new files anywhere writable by the application. This vulnerability leads to a major loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, but creating files outside a working tree without attempting to execute code can directly impact integrity as well. This vulnerability has been patched in version(s) 0.36.0.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-35186'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-35186</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-32969</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-05-23 09:15:09<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] vantage6 is an open-source infrastructure for privacy preserving analysis. Collaboration administrators can add extra organizations to their collaboration that can extend their influence. For example, organizations that they include can then create new users for which they know the passwords, and use that to read task results of other collaborations that that organization is involved in. This is only relatively trusted users - with access to manage a collaboration - are able to do this, which reduces the impact. This vulnerability was patched in version 4.5.0rc3.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-32969'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-32969</a>

An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current user. Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction in that a victim must open a malicious file.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-30280'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-30280</a>
