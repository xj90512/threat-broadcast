<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-28752</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-03-15 11:15:09<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] A SSRF vulnerability using the Aegis DataBinding in versions of Apache CXF before 4.0.4, 3.6.3 and 3.5.8 allows an attacker to perform SSRF style attacks on webservices that take at least one parameter of any type. Users of other data bindings (including the default databinding) are not impacted.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-28752'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-28752</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-27987</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-03-15 11:15:09<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in GiveWP Give allows Reflected XSS.This issue affects Give: from n/a through 3.3.1.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-27987'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-27987</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-23944</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-03-15 11:15:08<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Information disclosure in persistent watchers handling in Apache ZooKeeper due to missing ACL check. It allows an attacker to monitor child znodes by attaching a persistent watcher (addWatch command) to a parent which the attacker has already access to. ZooKeeper server doesn't do ACL check when the persistent watcher is triggered and as a consequence, the full path of znodes that a watch event gets triggered upon is exposed to the owner of the watcher. It's important to note that only the path is exposed by this vulnerability, not the data of znode, but since znode path can contain sensitive information like user name or login ID, this issue is potentially critical. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.9.2, 3.8.4 which fixes the issue.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-23944'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-23944</a>
