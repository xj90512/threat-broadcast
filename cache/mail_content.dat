<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-32013</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-04-06 20:15:15<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] LNbits is a Lightning wallet and accounts system. A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability has been discovered in LNbits' LNURL authentication handling functionality. When processing LNURL authentication requests, the application accepts a callback URL parameter and makes an HTTP request to that URL using the httpx library with redirect following enabled. The application doesn't properly validate the callback URL, allowing attackers to specify internal network addresses and access internal resources.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-32013'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-32013</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-31492</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-04-06 20:15:15<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] mod_auth_openidc is an OpenID Certified authentication and authorization module for the Apache 2.x HTTP server that implements the OpenID Connect Relying Party functionality. Prior to 2.4.16.11, a bug in a mod_auth_openidc results in disclosure of protected content to unauthenticated users. The conditions for disclosure are an OIDCProviderAuthRequestMethod POST, a valid account, and there mustn't be any application-level gateway (or load balancer etc) protecting the server. When you request a protected resource, the response includes the HTTP status, the HTTP headers, the intended response (the self-submitting form), and the protected resource (with no headers). This is an example of a request for a protected resource, including all the data returned. In the case where mod_auth_openidc returns a form, it has to return OK from check_userid so as not to go down the error path in httpd. This means httpd will try to issue the protected resource. oidc_content_handler is called early, which has the opportunity to prevent the normal output being issued by httpd. oidc_content_handler has a number of checks for when it intervenes, but it doesn't check for this case, so the handler returns DECLINED. Consequently, httpd appends the protected content to the response. The issue has been patched in mod_auth_openidc versions >= 2.4.16.11.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-31492'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-31492</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-31488</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-04-06 20:15:14<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Plain Craft Launcher (PCL) is a launcher for Minecraft. PCL allows users to use homepages provided by third parties. If controls such as WebBrowser are used in the homepage, WPF will use Internet Explorer to load the specified webpage. If the user uses a malicious homepage, the attacker can use IE background to access the specified webpage without knowing it. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.9.3.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-31488'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-31488</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2025-2260</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2025-04-06 19:15:41<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] In NetX HTTP server functionality of Eclipse ThreadX NetX Duo before version 6.4.3, an attacker can cause a denial of service by specially crafted packets. The core issue is missing closing of a file in case of an error condition, resulting in the 404 error for each further file request. Users can work-around the issue by disabling the PUT request support. This issue follows an incomplete fix of CVE-2025-0726.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-2260'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-2260</a>
