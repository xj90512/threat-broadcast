<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-6896</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-07-24 11:15:11<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The AMP for WP – Accelerated Mobile Pages plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.96.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-6896'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-6896</a>

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-6930</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-07-24 08:15:03<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] The WP Booking Calendar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'type' attribute within the plugin's bookingform shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 10.2.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-6930'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-6930</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-6874</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-07-24 08:15:03<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] libcurl's URL API function [curl_url_get()](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/curl_url_get.html) offers punycode conversions, to and from IDN. Asking to convert a name that is exactly 256 bytes, libcurl ends up reading outside of a stack based buffer when built to use the *macidn* IDN backend. The conversion function then fills up the provided buffer exactly - but does not null terminate the string. This flaw can lead to stack contents accidently getting returned as part of the converted string.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-6874'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-6874</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-6197</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-07-24 08:15:03<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] libcurl's ASN1 parser has this utf8asn1str() function used for parsing an ASN.1 UTF-8 string. Itcan detect an invalid field and return error. Unfortunately, when doing so it also invokes `free()` on a 4 byte localstack buffer. Most modern malloc implementations detect this error and immediately abort. Some however accept the input pointer and add that memory to its list of available chunks. This leads to the overwriting of nearby stack memory. The content of the overwrite is decided by the `free()` implementation; likely to be memory pointers and a set of flags. The most likely outcome of exploting this flaw is a crash, although it cannot be ruled out that more serious results can be had in special circumstances.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-6197'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-6197</a>

<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-39676</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-07-24 08:15:02<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability in Apache Pinot. This issue affects Apache Pinot: from 0.1 before 1.0.0. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.0.0 and configure RBAC, which fixes the issue. Details: When using a request to path “/appconfigs” to the controller, it can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information such as system information (e.g. arch, os version), environment information (e.g. maxHeapSize) and Pinot configurations (e.g. zookeeper path). This issue was addressed by the Role-based Access Control https://docs.pinot.apache.org/operators/tutorials/authentication/basic-auth-access-control , so that /appConfigs` and all other APIs can be access controlled. Only authorized users have access to it. Note the user needs to add the admin role accordingly to the RBAC guide to control access to this endpoint, and in the future version of Pinot, a default admin role is planned to be added.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-39676'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-39676</a>
