<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-30254</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-04-04 19:15:08<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] MesonLSP is an unofficial, unendorsed language server for meson written in C++. A vulnerability in versions prior to 4.1.4 allows overwriting arbitrary files if the attacker can make the victim either run the language server within a specific crafted project or `mesonlsp --full`. Version 4.1.4 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, avoid running `mesonlsp --full` and set the language server option `others.neverDownloadAutomatically` to `true`.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-30254'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-30254</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-30252</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-04-04 19:15:08<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Livemarks is a browser extension that provides RSS feed bookmark folders. Versions of Livemarks prior to 3.7 are vulnerable to cross-site request forgery. A malicious website may be able to coerce the extension to send an authenticated GET request to an arbitrary URL. An authenticated request is a request where the cookies of the browser are sent along with the request. The `subscribe.js` script uses the first parameter from the current URL location as the URL of the RSS feed to subscribe to and checks that the RSS feed is valid XML. `subscribe.js` is accessible by an attacker website due to its use in `subscribe.html`, an HTML page that is declared as a `web_accessible_resource` in `manifest.json`. This issue may lead to `Privilege Escalation`. A CSRF breaks the integrity of servers running on a private network. A user of the browser extension may have a private server with dangerous functionality, which is assumed to be safe due to network segmentation. Upon receiving an authenticated request instantiated from an attacker, this integrity is broken. Version 3.7 fixes this issue by removing subscribe.html from `web_accessible_resources`.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-30252'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-30252</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-30249</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-04-04 19:15:08<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] Cloudburst Network provides network components used within Cloudburst projects. A vulnerability in versions prior to `1.0.0.CR1-20240330.101522-15` impacts publicly accessible software depending on the affected versions of Network and allows an attacker to use Network as an amplification vector for a UDP denial of service attack against a third party or as an attempt to trigger service suspension of the host. All consumers of the library should upgrade to at least version `1.0.0.CR1-20240330.101522-15` to receive a fix. There are no known workarounds beyond updating the library.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-30249'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-30249</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-29193</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-04-04 19:15:08<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] gotortc is a camera streaming application. Versions 1.8.5 and prior are vulnerable to DOM-based cross-site scripting. The index page (`index.html`) shows the available streams by fetching the API (`[0]`) in the client side. Then, it uses `Object.entries` to iterate over the result (`[1]`) whose first item (`name`) gets appended using `innerHTML` (`[2]`). In the event of a victim visiting the server in question, their browser will execute the request against the go2rtc instance. After the request, the browser will be redirected to go2rtc, in which the XSS would be executed in the context of go2rtc’s origin. As of time of publication, no patch is available.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-29193'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-29193</a>

There is limited impact to integrity and availability. The attacker on the adjacent network with administration access can exploit the vulnerability.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-25007'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-25007</a>
<br/>==============================================<br/>[<b>漏洞来源</b>] Tenable (Nessus)<br/>[<b>漏洞编号</b>] <font color='blue'>CVE-2024-29192</font><br/>[<b>披露时间</b>] 2024-04-04 18:15:14<br/>[<b>漏洞描述</b>] gotortc is a camera streaming application. Versions 1.8.5 and prior are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery. The `/api/config` endpoint allows one to modify the existing configuration with user-supplied values. While the API is only allowing localhost to interact without authentication, an attacker may be able to achieve that depending on how go2rtc is set up on the upstream application, and given that this endpoint is not protected against CSRF, it allows requests from any origin (e.g. a "drive-by" attack) . The `exec` handler allows for any stream to execute arbitrary commands. An attacker may add a custom stream through `api/config`, which may lead to arbitrary command execution. In the event of a victim visiting the server in question, their browser will execute the requests against the go2rtc instance. Commit 8793c3636493c5efdda08f3b5ed5c6e1ea594fd9 adds a warning about secure API access.<br/>[<b>相关链接</b>] <a href='https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-29192'>https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-29192</a>
